1,"Rapid firing of cerebellar Purkinje neurons is facilitated in part by a voltage-gated Na+ (NaV) 'resurgent' current, which allows renewed Na+ influx during membrane repolarization. Resurgent current results from unbinding of a blocking particle that competes with normal channel inactivation. The underlying molecular components contributing to resurgent current have not been fully identified. Here, we show that the NaV channel auxiliary subunit FGF14 'b' isoform, a locus for inherited spinocerebellar ataxias, controls resurgent current and repetitive firing in Purkinje neurons. FGF14 knockdown biased NaV channels towards the inactivated state by decreasing channel availability, diminishing the 'late' NaV current, and accelerating channel inactivation rate, thereby reducing resurgent current and repetitive spiking. Critical for these effects was both the alternatively spliced FGF14b N-terminus and direct interaction between FGF14b and the NaV C-terminus. Together, these data suggest that the FGF14b N-terminus is a potent regulator of resurgent NaV current in cerebellar Purkinje neurons."
2,"[Drug-related Anaphylactic Shocks: Under-reporting and PMSI.]"
3,"Aim. To evaluate the value of research in the case-mix database to identify cases of drug-related anaphylactic or anaphylactoid shock. Methods. Hospital stays of patients discharged from the University Hospital of Saint-Etienne between July 1st 2009 and June 30th 2012. Five codes from the international classification of diseases were selected: T88.6, T88.2, J39.3, T80.5 and T78.2. Results. Among 89 cases identified by the programme for medicalization of information system (programme de medicalisation des systemes d'information, PMSI), 40 were selected (45%). Of these, 16 cases were spontaneously reported by physicians. The unspecific code ""anaphylactic shock unspecified (T78.2)"" was coded for 57.5% of cases. Conclusion. The study confirms the interest of the PMSI as a tool for health monitoring, in addition to spontaneous reporting. Nevertheless, coding with insufficient precision about the causal role of the drug, requires a return to the medical record and so an important time consuming process."
4,"Fever Evaluation Cost and Time to Treatment in the General Surgery Patient Can be Reduced by Using a Fever Practice Guideline."
5,"OBJECTIVES: Evaluation of surgical patients with fever and leukocytosis (FAL) for an infection source often results in unnecessary laboratory and radiographic tests. The average cost of an FAL work-up ranges from $2200 to $5600. Lack of a systematic approach drives costs higher than necessary. We evaluated differences in time to treatment and costs using usual methods of FAL work-ups versus FAL work-ups using an established fever practice guideline (FPG). METHODS: In phase I, a retrospective electronic chart review was conducted for 82 adult surgery patients who underwent FAL work-ups to determine time from initial temperature presentation to fever treatment and total cost per fever evaluation. In phase II, an established FPG was applied to 30 intensive care unit patients from the original group of 82 using phase I data points. Differences in cost and time to treatment were compared using a paired t-test. RESULTS: Mean time to fever treatment decreased from 51.57 hours pre-FPG use to 11.23 hours afterward (p < 0.001), a 78% reduction in time to definitive treatment. Mean cost of FAL work-up decreased from $1,009.73 without FPG use to $399.00 with a 60% reduction in costs. CONCLUSIONS: Using a standardized FPG, FAL work-up time to treatment and cost can be significantly reduced."
6,"Factors Associated With Obesity: A Case-Control Study of Young Adult Singaporean Males."
7,"A case-control study among Singapore Armed Forces' newly enlisted Servicemen was conducted to examine factors associated with male obesity. Four hundred and fifty-nine individuals from the Obese Basic Military Training program were selected as ""cases"" (average age: 19.5, body mass index: 30.4) and another 340 individuals were selected from the Normal Basic Military Training program as ""controls"" (average age: 19.3, body mass index: 21.4). Information such as family background, socioeconomic factors, and lifestyle practices were captured using facilitator-led questionnaires. Several variables were significantly associated with obesity after adjustments for possible confounders. These include childhood obesity (odds ratio [OR] = 2.06), less than an hour of exercise per day (OR = 2.97), Indian ethnicity (OR = 2.22), specific education backgrounds (especially that of Institute of Technical Education-OR = 2.75), father's employment at nonmanagerial/professional jobs (OR = 1.52), mother's employment at managerial/professional jobs (OR = 2.02), regular smoking (OR = 1.73) and alcohol consumption (OR = 2.26), 6 hours or less of sleep (OR = 3.73), obesity among family members (OR = 1.86 for mother; OR = 2.98 for siblings), parental history of diabetes mellitus (OR = 2.22 for father; OR = 2.70 for mother), and eating at inexpensive local food stalls (OR = 1.82). Our study found that a number of factors, ranging from personal and family backgrounds to lifestyle choices, were significantly associated with obesity among male youths."
8,"The Ketamine Analog Methoxetamine: A New Designer Drug to Threaten Military Readiness."
9,"Recent years have seen the emergence and proliferation of ""legal highs"" or ""designer drugs,"" compounds purposefully designed as legal alternatives to controlled substances of abuse. This article describes methoxetamine, a dissociative drug belonging to the arylcyclohexylamine class including phencyclidine and ketamine. Methoxetamine acts principally on the glutamatergic N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor and the serotonin receptor. It is sold as a white or off-white powder. Marketed as a ""bladder friendly"" alternative to ketamine, preliminary research suggests renal and cystic toxicity similar to ketamine. Methoxetamine is primarily ingested nasally, though also orally, intramuscularly, intravenously, and rectally. Users report dissociative features and, at higher doses, an ""m-hole"" experience akin to ketamine's ""k-hole"" described as extreme depersonalization and derealization. The 13 cases of acute methoxetamine toxicity described in the literature are summarized. The toxidrome consists of dissociation/delirium, sympathetic activation, and cerebellar symptoms. Methoxetamine is not detected in standard urine drug tests and there are no reliable laboratory findings. Management of acute methoxetamine toxicity is supportive, consisting of benzodiazepines, antiemetics, intravenous fluids, and respiratory support as indicated. Should methoxetamine conform to the observed 2-year lag of designer drugs migrating from Europe to the United States usage may increase in early 2014."
10,"Use and Abuse of Prescribed Opioids, Central Nervous System Depressants, and Stimulants Among U.S. Active Duty Military Personnel in FY 2010."
11,"OBJECTIVES: This study establishes rates of use/abuse of Schedule II-IV prescription medications in U.S. active duty military personnel, and characterizes correlates of such use/abuse. METHODS: All active duty personnel serving for 12 months during fiscal year 2010 were included. Data were obtained from medical and pharmacy claims and drug screening results. Logistic regression models were used to examine predictors of drug use, along with bivariate analyses to compare abuse of prescribed and illegal drugs. RESULTS: Nearly one-third of active duty service members received at least one prescription for opioids, central nervous system depressants, or stimulants, with 26.4% having received at least one prescription for opioids. About 0.7%, 1.4%, and 0.6% of the total force received >90-day prescriptions for opioids, central nervous system depressants, or stimulants, respectively. Battlefield injury, receipt of psychotropic medications, and substance abuse adverse events were predictive of >90-day supply of opioids. About 0.7% of the total force had documented known drug abuse for prescribed drugs compared to 0.4% for illegal drug abuse. CONCLUSIONS: We recommend systematic monitoring of prescriptions for controlled substances which may carry serious consequences, evaluation of the impact of controlled substances on military readiness, and examination of the rationale for prescribing controlled drugs."
12,"Stellate Ganglion Block Used to Treat Symptoms Associated With Combat-Related Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder: A Case Series of 166 Patients."
13,"OBJECTIVE: Report the successful use of stellate ganglion blocks (SGBs) in 166 active duty service members with multiple combat deployments experiencing anxiety symptoms associated with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). BACKGROUND: Successful treatment of PTSD symptoms with SGB has been reported previously. This is the largest published case series evaluating SGB with a minimum of 3 months follow-up. METHODS: Following clinical interview including administration of the PTSD Checklist (PCL), 166 service members with symptoms of PTSD elected to receive a SGB. All patients received a SGB on the right side at the level of the sixth cervical vertebrae (C6). The PCL was administered the day before treatment to establish a baseline, repeated 1 week later, and then monthly out to 3 months. A positive response was considered to be an improvement in the PCL score by 10 or greater points. Follow-up PCL scores from 3 to 6 months were obtained and analyzed for 166 patients. RESULTS: In a military population with multiple combat deployments, over 70% of the patients treated had a clinically significant improvement in their PCL score which persisted beyond 3 to 6 months postprocedure. CONCLUSION: Selective blockade of the right cervical sympathetic chain at the C6 level is a safe and minimally invasive procedure that may provide durable relief from anxiety symptoms associated with PTSD."
14,"Identifying Classes of Veterans With Multiple Risk Factors."
15,"As researchers examine the efficacy of interventions that simultaneously target more than 1 symptom, it is important to identify ways to help guide research and program development. This study used electronic medical record data to examine the covariation of multiple risk factors regularly assessed among primary care patients. It also examined the health care utilization of those patients identifying where the health care system came in contact with them to help identify the ideal locations these interventions may be most often used. We obtained data for six risk factors, as well as the number of primary care, mental health, and emergency department visits, from Veteran patients with a primary care visit. There were three main groups of primary care patients, identified using latent class analysis and regression. Although the smallest group, the ""High Treatment Need"" group, had an increased probability of screening positive for all four risk factors, the post-traumatic stress disorder screen was a significant discriminator of this group from the others. Results show that this group had the greatest number of encounters in all health care locations suggesting significant opportunities for intervention. However, future research is needed to examine the current interventions offered and potential avenues where risk factors may be addressed simultaneously."
16,"Injury Epidemiology of U.S. Army Special Operations Forces."
17,"Musculoskeletal injuries have long been a problem in general purpose forces, yet anecdotal evidence provided by medical, human performance, and training leadership suggests musculoskeletal injuries are also a readiness impediment to Special Operations Forces (SOF). The purpose of this study was to describe the injury epidemiology of SOF utilizing self-reported injury histories. Data were collected on 106 SOF (age: 31.7 +/- 5.3 years, height: 179.0 +/- 5.5 cm, mass: 85.9 +/- 10.9 kg) for 1 year before the date of laboratory testing and filtered for total injuries and those with the potential to be preventable based on injury type, activity, and mechanism. The frequency of musculoskeletal injuries was 24.5 injuries per 100 subjects per year for total injuries and 18.9 injuries per 100 subjects per year for preventable injuries. The incidence of musculoskeletal injuries was 20.8 injured subjects per 100 subjects per year for total injuries and 16.0 injured subjects per 100 subjects per year for preventable injuries. Preventable musculoskeletal injuries comprised 76.9% of total injuries. Physical training (PT) was the most reported activity for total/preventable injuries (PT Command Organized: 46.2%/60.0%, PT Noncommand Organized: 7.7%/10.0%, PT Unknown: 3.8%/5.0%). Musculoskeletal injuries impede optimal physical readiness/tactical training in the SOF community. The data suggest a significant proportion of injuries are classified as preventable and may be mitigated with human performance programs."
18,"A Review of Mild Traumatic Brain Injury Diagnostics: Current Perspectives, Limitations, and Emerging Technology."
19,"Mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) or concussion is a common battlefield and in-garrison injury caused by transmission of mechanical forces to the head. The energy transferred in such events can cause structural and/or functional changes in the brain that manifest as focal neurological, cognitive, or behavioral dysfunction. Current diagnostic criteria for mTBI are highly limited, variable, and based on subjective self-report. The subjective nature of the symptoms, both in quantity and quality, together with their large overlap in other physical and behavioral maladies, limit the clinician's ability to accurately diagnose, treat, and make prognostic decisions after such injuries. These diagnostic challenges are magnified in an operational environment as well. The Department of Defense has invested significant resources into improving the diagnostic tools and accuracy for mTBI. This focus has been to supplement the clinician's examination with technology that is better able to objectify brain dysfunction after mTBI. Through this review, we discuss the current state of three promising technologies-soluble protein biomarkers, advanced neuroimaging, and quantitative electroencephalography-that are of particular interest within military medicine."
20,"Insomnia Treatment Experience and Preferences Among Veterans Affairs Primary Care Patients."
21,"Insomnia is common, but undertreated, among primary care patients. Within the Veterans Health Administration (VA), increasing attention has been given to the treatment of insomnia within primary care settings, but little research has examined Veterans' treatment preferences. We examined preferences for sleep treatment among VA primary care patients. Participants (N = 126: 98% male, 89% white; M age = 60 years) completed a brief survey. On the basis of Insomnia Severity Index scores, 22% reported subthreshold and 13% moderate insomnia. Fifty percent reported having issues with sleep (falling asleep, staying asleep, or sleeping too much) in the past 12 months; among these, only 44% reported any discussion of medication (34%) or other strategies (32%) to improve sleep with medical providers. The most preferred treatment approach was to work it out on one's own, followed by consulting the primary care provider (PCP). The most preferred modality was a one-on-one meeting with the PCP, followed by a one-on-one meeting with the behavioral health provider. In conclusion, VA primary care patients preferred handling sleep problems on their own, but if seeking help, they preferred working with PCPs over behavioral health providers. The majority of Veterans preferred individual treatment and strategies other than medication."
22,"Residual Injury, Appearance-Related Concerns, Symptoms of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder, and Depression Within a Treatment-Seeking Veteran Sample."
23,"This study explored the associations among injury-related appearance changes experienced during deployment/combat, symptom severity of post-traumatic stress disorder and depression, and body image distress within a treatment-seeking veteran population (n = 91). Thirty-three percent of the sample reported having an appearance-related residual injury experienced during combat or deployment (n = 30). A subsample, who completed the body image distress measure (n = 69), was divided into two groups: those with an appearance-related residual injury (n = 22) and those without an appearance-related residual injury (n = 47). Correlational analyses revealed significant, positive correlations between body image distress and depression symptom severity. Results also showed a trend relationship between body image distress and post-traumatic stress disorder symptom severity for those with an appearance-related residual injury although correlations were nonsignificant among these constructs for those without an appearance-related residual injury. Multiple regression analyses revealed that body image distress was a unique predictor of depression symptom severity, controlling for residual injury status. Implications of these findings for exploring the psychological impact of residual injury were discussed."
24,"Bioassay-guided fractionation of extracts from Easter lily (Lilium longiflorum) flowers reveals unprecedented structural variability of steroidal glycoalkaloids."
25,"Several Lilium species are nephrotoxic in cats (Felis silvestris catus), among them Easter lilies (Lilium longiflorum). Although clinical trials have been carried out, the causative toxic phytochemicals have not yet been identified. We thus aimed to determine the toxic constituents of Easter lily flowers applying a bioassay-guided approach based on a feline kidney cell line model. The bioassay-guided fractionation traced the observed cytotoxicity to a complex mixture of compounds that were tentatively identified as steroidal glycoalkaloids of the solasodine-type, based on multiple-fragmentation ion trap and high-resolution mass spectrometry. The glycoalkaloids in the active fraction possessed trisaccharide chains, and at least 16 different congeners could be separated using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. The two principal compounds were solasodine trisaccharides containing two hexose and one deoxy-hexose unit. In the remaining 14 analogues, one or two of the hydroxyl groups of the second hexose from the aglycone were acetylated. In addition, some of the analogues appeared to be carbonate esters. Esterification of steroidal glycoalkaloids in plants has only been reported once and was in accordance with higher antifungal activity of the acetylated versus the parent congener. Our pilot study shows that esterification of steroidal glycoalkaloids in Lilium species might be common resulting in an array of different analogues with largely unexplored structural variability and bioactivity."
26,"Validation of the Chinese-language Brief Sensation Seeking Scale: Implications for risky riding behaviors of parental motorcyclists and their child passengers."
27,"Motorcycles are the leading cause of road traffic deaths in the Western Pacific and Southeast Asia, where Mandarin Chinese is the most commonly used language. Sensation seeking (SS) is reported to correlate with many risky motor vehicle behaviors, and therefore a culture-adapted Chinese instrument is needed to assess this personality trait in Chinese-speaking motorcycling populations. The standard front and blinded-backward process was carried out to formulate the Chinese-language Brief Sensation Seeking Scale (C-BSSS). 193 parental motorcyclists who rode with their young children were interviewed concerning their SS levels, demographics, riding behaviors, and the driving/riding experiences. A random sample of 30 subjects was re-interviewed 1-2 weeks later to examine the test-retest reliability. Psychometric analyses revealed satisfactory item characteristics, internal consistency, intraobserver reliability, and interobserver reliability. Additionally, parental motorcyclists who had the following characteristics were more likely to be the high sensation seekers (SSers), including male, younger age, presenting risky motor vehicle behaviors of themselves (e.g., higher riding speeds, operating after drinking, using a mobile phone while operating, and receiving a traffic ticket), and carrying child passengers who demonstrated dangerous motorcycling behaviors (e.g., a younger age, non-helmeted, and overloaded). We conclude that the C-BSSS is a useful and reliable measure of SS for ethnic Chinese populations. This instrument may be helpful to develop the future prevention strategy of motorcycle injuries in Chinese parental motorcyclists and their young child passengers."
28,"Sperm morphological normality under high magnification predicts laboratory and clinical outcomes in couples undergoing ICSI."
29,"The objective of this study was to evaluate whether 'motile sperm organelle morphology examination' (MSOME) is correlated with the outcome of ICSI. A total of 14400 spermatozoa from 72 couples undergoing ICSI were analysed by MSOME (x6600) and graded into four groups: grade I, normal form and no vacuoles; grade II, normal form and lesser than or equal to 2 small vacuoles; grade III, normal form greater than 2 small vacuoles or at least one large vacuole and grade IV, large vacuole and abnormal head shapes or other abnormalities. The correlations between the proportion of morphologically normal spermatozoa (grade I + II) and ICSI outcomes were assessed. The proportion of grade I+ II spermatozoa was lower in patients with oligoasthenoteratozoospermia (OAT) compared to patients with other types of semen alterations (10.6% vs. 17.0%, p = 0.001). The proportion of grade I+ II spermatozoa was positively correlated with blastocyst formation (S = 8.31, R2:13.5%, p = 0.014) and implantation rates (S = 8.32, R2: 7.9%, p = 0.030). The proportion of grade I + II spermatozoa was higher in patients with ongoing pregnancy in comparison with those who had a miscarriage (23.2% vs. 10.8%, p = 0.007). Sperm morphological normality was lower in oligoasthenoteratozoospermia patients but correlated with blastocyst formation, implantation and miscarriage rates in couples undergoing ICSI. MSOME may be valuable in predicting ICSI outcomes."
30,"Low pertussis toxin antibody levels in two regional cohorts of Canadian pregnant women."
31,"Infants under 6 months of age are at greatest risk of mortality and severe morbidity from pertussis disease. Interventions that increase pertussis protection in newborns are therefore a clear public health imperative. The objective of this study was to assess maternal pertussis toxin antibody (anti-PT) level as a potential source of mother-to-child transfer of pertussis-associated antibodies that may reduce neonatal risk of pertussis disease. Anti-PT level was assessed in a 2013 cohort of pregnant women from two regions in two Canadian provinces, British Columbia and Nova Scotia. Basic demographics, health, and pertussis immunization history were collected, along with blood specimens. Anti-PT levels were compared for self-reported vaccination status and prior pertussis disease. To assess secular trend, a parallel analysis was also undertaken, using anonymized residual sera from a 1996-1997 cohort of pregnant women in British Columbia. A total of 169 pregnant women participated in the prospective study - 50 from Nova Scotia and 119 from British Columbia. The mean and median age of participants from both sites was 31 years of age (range 16-42 years). The lower limit of quantification of the anti-PT assay was 10 ELISA units per milliliter (EU/ml). Overall, 59% of women had anti-PT levels less than 10EU/ml and anti-PT level did not differ with time since last self-reported pertussis vaccination (chi2(2)=3.166, p=0.205). Among a 1996-1997 cohort of pregnant women in British Columbia, 51% had anti-PT levels less than 10EU/ml. Our study found that most pregnant women in two geographically disparate health regions in Canada have low residual anti-PT levels, may be vulnerable to pertussis infection themselves, and would unlikely be a source of passive ante- or postnatal transfer of anti-PT to their newborn."
32,"Soluble ST2 in heart failure."
33,"In addition to routine clinical laboratory tests (including natriuretic peptides and cardiac troponins), other biomarkers are gaining attention for their utility in heart failure (HF) management. Among them, soluble ST2 (sST2) a novel biomarker integrating inflammation, fibrosis, and cardiac stress has been included in the 2013 ACCF/AHA guideline for additive risk stratification of patients with acute and chronic HF. sST2 is an interleukin-1 (IL-1) receptor family member, is secreted into the circulation and functions as a ""decoy"" receptor for IL-33, inhibiting IL-33/ST2 signaling. Blood concentrations of sST2 are increased in various diseases such as inflammatory diseases and heart diseases and are considered a valuable prognostic marker in both conditions. sST2 lacks disease specificity and, therefore, is not a valuable marker for the diagnosis of HF. In acute and chronic HF, however, sST2 is strongly associated with measures of HF severity and poor outcome. Several studies in patients with HF indicate that serial measurement of sST2 has prognostic value and could have a potential role in future biomarker-directed therapy. In this review, the role of sST2 as a HF biomarker will be discussed, specifically addressing analytical considerations of measuring sST2 as well as the clinical applications of measurement of sST2 for the diagnosis, prognosis and monitoring of acute and chronic HF."
34,"An Improved Flow Cytometric Immunobead Array to Detect Autoantibodies in Plasma from Patients with Immune Thrombocytopenic Purpura."
35,"BACKGROUND: Autoantibodies against platelet glycoproteins (GPs) play an important role in immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP). This study was to develop an improved flow cytometric immunobead array (FCIA) assay to detect platelet autoantibodies in ITP patient plasma. METHODS: Plasma samples were isolated from 71 ITP patients and 136 non-ITP controls and incubated with platelets from normal individuals. After washing, platelets were lysed and the platelet lysates were incubated with polystyrene microbeads coupled with monoclonal antibodies against human GPs IX (SZ1), Ib (SZ2), IIIa (SZ21), IIb (SZ22), and P-selectin (SZ51). Platelet GP-autoantibody complexes were detected by flow cytometry using a FITC-labeled secondary antibody. RESULT: Autoantibodies against platelet GPIb, GPIIb, GPIIIa, GPIX and P-selectin were detected in plasma from ITP patients, as indicated by high mean fluorescent intensity values when microbeads with antibodies SZ1, SZ2, SZ21, SZ22, and SZ51 were used. In ROC analysis, values of the area under the curve were 0.74, 0.83, 0.80, 0.79 and 0.87, respectively. Compared with the previously reported assays, this new FCIA eliminated the need of isolating platelets from ITP patients without compromising assay sensitivity and accuracy in predicting ITP. CONCLUSION: This simplified FICA assay may be more suitable for ITP diagnosis in clinical laboratory settings."
36,"ACOUSTIC TRAPPING FOR BACTERIA IDENTIFICATION IN POSITIVE BLOOD CULTURES WITH MALDI-TOF MS."
37,"Matrix assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) is current-ly changing the clinical routine for identification of microbial pathogens. One important application is the rap-id identification of bacteria for the diagnosis of bloodstream infections (BSI). A novel approach based on acoustic trapping and an integrated selective enrichment target (ISET) microchip that improves the sample preparation step for this type of analysis is presented. The method is evaluated on clinically relevant samples in the form of Escherichia coli infected blood-cultures. It is shown that non-contact acoustic trapping enables capture, enrichment and washing of bacteria directly from the complex background of crude blood cultures. The technology replaces centrifugation-based separation with a faster and highly automated sample prepara-tion method that minimizes manual handling of hazardous pathogens. The presented method includes a solid phase extraction step that was optimized for enrichment of the bacterial proteins and peptides that are used for bacterial identification. The acoustic trapping-based assay provided correct identification in 12 out 12 cases of E. coli positive blood cultures with an average score of 2.19+/-0.09 compared to 1.98+/-0.08 when using the standard assay. This new technology opens up for the possibility to automate and speed up an important and widely used diagnostic assay for bloodstream infections."
38,"Image Analysis for the Quantitative Comparison of Stress Fibers and Focal Adhesions."
39,"Actin stress fibers (SFs) detect and transmit forces to the extracellular matrix through focal adhesions (FAs), and molecules in this pathway determine cellular behavior. Here, we designed two different computational tools to quantify actin SFs and the distribution of actin cytoskeletal proteins within a normalized cellular morphology. Moreover, a systematic cell response comparison between the control cells and those with impaired actin cytoskeleton polymerization was performed to demonstrate the reliability of the tools. Indeed, a variety of proteins that were present within the string beginning at the focal adhesions (vinculin) up to the actin SFs contraction (non-muscle myosin II (NMMII)) were analyzed. Finally, the software used allows for the quantification of the SFs based on the relative positions of FAs. Therefore, it provides a better insight into the cell mechanics and broadens the knowledge of the nature of SFs."
40,"Gr-1+CD11b+ Immature Myeloid Cells (IMC) Promote Resistance of Pro-Inflammatory T Cells to Suppression by Regulatory T Cells in Atherosclerotic Apo E- Deficient Mice."
41,"Accumulating evidence indicates that both defects in Treg numbers and/or function as well as resistance of effector T cells to suppression may contribute to the development of human chronic inflammatory diseases. However, which mechanism involved in the progression of atherosclerosis remains unclear. In this study, we evaluated the production and function of CD4+ inflammatory and regulatory T cells in atherosclerosis-prone mice. We found that the hyperactivity and unresponsiveness to Treg-mediated suppression of inflammatory CD4+ T cells occurred in the progression of atherosclerosis, though Treg cells were present in very large numbers and fully functional. We further found that Gr-1+CD11b+ immature myeloid cells were significantly accumulated in atherosclerotic Apo E-/- mice, and they promoted resistance of inflammatory CD4+ T cells to Treg-mediated suppression in vitro and in vivo. we further confirmed that Gr-1+CD11b+ immature myeloid cells produced high level of interleukin 6 which was at least partially responsible for inducing unresponsiveness of inflammatory CD4+ T cells to suppression via activation of Jak/Stat signaling pathway. Taken together, these findings might provide new insights to explore potential targets for immune therapeutic intervention in atherosclerosis."
42,"Development of CpG-Oligodeoxynucleotides for Effective Activation of Rabbit TLR9 Mediated Immune Responses."
43,"CpG-oligodeoxynucleotides (CpG-ODN) are potent immune stimuli being developed for use as adjuvants in different species. Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9) is the cellular receptor for CpG-ODN in mammalian cells. The CpG-ODN with 18-24 deoxynucleotides that are in current use for human and mouse cells, however, have low activity with rabbit TLR9. Using a cell-based activation assay, we developed a type of CpG-ODN containing a GACGTT or AACGTT motif in 12 phosphorothioate-modified deoxynucleotides with potent stimulatory activity for rabbit TLR9. The developed CpG-ODN have higher activities than other developed CpG-ODN in eliciting antigen-nonspecific immune responses in rabbit splenocytes. When mixed with an NJ85 peptide derived from rabbit hemorrhagic disease virus, they had potent activities to boost an antigen-specific T cell activation and antibody production in rabbits. Compared to Freund's adjuvant, the developed CpG-ODN are capable of boosting a potent and less toxic antibody response. The results of this study suggest that both the choice of CpG-motif and its length are important factors for CpG-ODN to effectively activate rabbit TLR9 mediated immune responses."
44,"Characterization of Clostridium difficile Isolates from Human Fecal Samples and Retail Meat from Pennsylvania."
45,"Abstract A study was conducted to determine the prevalence of Clostridium difficile and characterize C. difficile isolates from human stool and retail grocery meat samples. Human stool samples (n=317) were obtained from a clinical laboratory and meat samples (n=303) were collected from 8 retail grocery stores from October 2011 through September 2012 from Centre County of Pennsylvania and were examined for C. difficile. C. difficile was isolated from 16.7% of stool samples (n=317) and 6.9%, 11.5%, 14.5%, and 7.8% of beef (n=72), pork (n=78), turkey (n=76), and chicken (n=77) samples, respectively. Six different toxin gene profiles were detected in all human and meat isolates of C. difficile based on the presence or absence of toxin genes tcdA, tcdB, and cdtA and cdtB. Interestingly, 75.6% of the human C. difficile isolates lacked any deletion in the tcdC gene (139-bp), whereas a 39-bp deletion was observed in 61.3% of the C. difficile strains isolated from meat samples. C. difficile from meat samples were more susceptible to clindamycin, moxifloxacin, vancomycin, and metronidazole than C. difficile isolates from human samples. Twenty-five different ribotypes were identified in human and meat C. difficile isolates. In conclusion, significant genotypic and phenotypic differences were observed between human and meat isolates of C. difficile; however, a few C. difficile isolates from meat-in particular ribotypes 078, PA01, PA05, PA16, and PA22 with unique profiles (toxin gene, tcdC gene size and antimicrobial resistance profiles)-were similar to human C. difficile isolates."
46,"Hospital Disaster Response Using Business Impact Analysis."
47,"Introduction The catastrophic Great East Japan Earthquake in 2011 created a crisis in a university-affiliated hospital by disrupting the water supply for 10 days. In response, this study was conducted to analyze water use and prioritize water consumption in each department of the hospital by applying a business impact analysis (BIA). Identifying the minimum amount of water necessary for continuing operations during a disaster was an additional goal. Problem Water is essential for many hospital operations and disaster-ready policies must be in place for the safety and continued care of patients. METHODS: A team of doctors, nurses, and office workers in the hospital devised a BIA questionnaire to examine all operations using water. The questionnaire included department name, operation name, suggested substitutes for water, and the estimated daily amount of water consumption. Operations were placed in one of three ranks (S, A, or B) depending on the impact on patients and the need for operational continuity. Recovery time objective (RTO), which is equivalent to the maximum tolerable period of disruption, was determined. Furthermore, the actual use of water and the efficiency of substitute methods, practiced during the water-disrupted periods, were verified in each operation. RESULTS: There were 24 activities using water in eight departments, and the estimated water consumption in the hospital was 326 (SD = 17) m3 per day: 64 (SD = 3) m3 for S (20%), 167 (SD = 8) m3 for A (51%), and 95 (SD = 5) m3 for B operations (29%). During the disruption, the hospital had about 520 m3 of available water. When the RTO was set to four days, the amount of water available would have been 130 m3 per day. During the crisis, 81% of the substitute methods were used for the S and A operations. CONCLUSION: This is the first study to identify and prioritize hospital operations necessary for the efficient continuation of medical treatment during suspension of the water supply by applying a BIA. Understanding the priority of operations and the minimum daily water requirement for each operation is important for a hospital in the event of an unexpected adverse situation, such as a major disaster.

48,"Both Central and Peripheral Auditory Systems Are Involved in Salicylate-Induced Tinnitus in Rats: A Behavioral Study."
49,"OBJECTIVE: This study was designed to establish a low dose salicylate-induced tinnitus rat model and to investigate whether central or peripheral auditory system is involved in tinnitus. METHODS: Lick suppression ratio (R), lick count and lick latency of conditioned rats in salicylate group (120 mg/kg, intraperitoneally) and saline group were first compared. Bilateral auditory nerves were ablated in unconditioned rats and lick count and lick latency were compared before and after ablation. The ablation was then performed in conditioned rats and lick count and lick latency were compared between salicylate group and saline group and between ablated and unablated salicylate groups. RESULTS: Both the R value and the lick count in salicylate group were significantly higher than those in saline group and lick latency in salicylate group was significantly shorter than that in saline group. No significant changes were observed in lick count and lick latency before and after ablation. After ablation, lick count and lick latency in salicylate group were significantly higher and shorter respectively than those in saline group, but they were significantly lower and longer respectively than those in unablated salicylate group. CONCLUSION: A low dose of salicylate (120 mg/kg) can induce tinnitus in rats and both central and peripheral auditory systems participate in the generation of salicylate-induced tinnitus."
50,"Physical Activity versus Cardiorespiratory Fitness: Two (Partly) Distinct Components of Cardiovascular Health?"
51,"Physical activity (PA) and cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) both have inverse relationships to cardiovascular (CV) morbidity and mortality. Recent position papers and guidelines have identified the important role of both of these factors in CV health. The benefits of PA and CRF in the prevention of CV disease and risk factors are reviewed. In addition, assessment methodology and utilization in the research and clinical arenas are discussed. Finally, the benefits, methodology, and utilization are compared and contrasted to better understand the two (partly) distinct components and their impact on CV health."
52,"Physical Activity and Cardiorespiratory Fitness as Major Markers of Cardiovascular Risk: Their Independent and Interwoven Importance to Health Status."
53,"The evolution from hunting and gathering to agriculture, followed by industrialization, has had a profound effect on human physical activity (PA) patterns. Current PA patterns are undoubtedly the lowest they have been in human history, with particularly marked declines in recent generations, and future projections indicate further declines around the globe. Non-communicable health problems that afflict current societies are fundamentally attributable to the fact that PA patterns are markedly different than those for which humans were genetically adapted. The advent of modern statistics and epidemiological methods has made it possible to quantify the independent effects of cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) and PA on health outcomes. Based on more than five decades of epidemiological studies, it is now widely accepted that higher PA patterns and levels of CRF are associated with better health outcomes. This review will discuss the evidence supporting the premise that PA and CRF are independent risk factors for cardiovascular disease (CVD) as well as the interplay between both PA and CRF and other CVD risk factors. A particular focus will be given to the interplay between CRF, metabolic risk and obesity."
54,"More than 10 Million Steps in the Right Direction: Results from the First American Heart Association Scientific Sessions Walking Challenge."
55,"In 2013, the Global Congress theme at the American Heart Association (AHA) Annual Scientific Sessions was Physical Activity (PA). As a key component of the Congress, iHealth working in collaboration with AHA provided a Bluetooth-enabled wireless PA and sleep tracker to up to 2,000 Scientific Sessions attendees. Approximately 1,850 Scientific Sessions attendees registered for, received an PA tracker and participated in the Walking Challenge. More than 10 million steps were walked by participants (10,703,504) during the 2.5days of the Walking Challenge. This translates into almost 6000 miles walked (5976.3 miles) and 656,716 calories burned by participants during the Challenge. The Global Congress of PA held at Scientific Sessions 2013 not only extensively reviewed the science of PA as a powerful/independent and, most importantly, modifiable cardiovascular risk factor, but it also provided evidence from a fun and entertaining challenge that PA as a risk behavior can be assessed and targeted. We just took 10 million steps in the right direction. Join us and make your steps count!"
56,"Effects of Virtual Speaker Density and Room Reverberation on Spatiotemporal Thresholds of Audio-Visual Motion Coherence."
57,"The present study examined the effects of spatial sound-source density and reverberation on the spatiotemporal window for audio-visual motion coherence. Three different acoustic stimuli were generated in Virtual Auditory Space: two acoustically ""dry"" stimuli via the measurement of anechoic head-related impulse responses recorded at either 1 degrees or 5 degrees spatial intervals (Experiment 1), and a reverberant stimulus rendered from binaural room impulse responses recorded at 5 degrees intervals in situ in order to capture reverberant acoustics in addition to head-related cues (Experiment 2). A moving visual stimulus with invariant localization cues was generated by sequentially activating LED's along the same radial path as the virtual auditory motion. Stimuli were presented at 25 degrees /s, 50 degrees /s and 100 degrees /s with a random spatial offset between audition and vision. In a 2AFC task, subjects made a judgment of the leading modality (auditory or visual). No significant differences were observed in the spatial threshold based on the point of subjective equivalence (PSE) or the slope of psychometric functions (beta) across all three acoustic conditions. Additionally, both the PSE and beta did not significantly differ across velocity, suggesting a fixed spatial window of audio-visual separation. Findings suggest that there was no loss in spatial information accompanying the reduction in spatial cues and reverberation levels tested, and establish a perceptual measure for assessing the veracity of motion generated from discrete locations and in echoic environments."
58,"Adenoid Cystic Carcinoma in the Cavernous Sinus Diagnosed with the Endoscopic Endonasal Approach."
59,"A 42-year-old woman presented with right oculomotor, abducens, and trigeminal palsy. Neuroimaging revealed a small lesion in the right cavernous sinus mimicking meningioma. Because the symptoms gradually worsened, the patient underwent an endoscopic endonasal transsphenoidal surgery for tumor biopsy. Histological examination of the surgical specimen revealed adenoid cystic carcinoma (ACC). Before and after the operation, no evidence of other primary lesions could be detected. The patient was treated with stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS). ACC in the cavernous sinus can be difficult to diagnosis before histological confirmation, because it is extremely rare as a primary lesion and resembles a cavernous sinus meningioma on neuroimaging studies. Two years after the first SRS, the tumor recurred along the trigeminal nerve and SRS was performed again. Our study illustrates that in case in which a lesion in the cavernous sinus progresses on neurological and neuroimaging studies, a biopsy should be taken to provide most accurate diagnosis and treatment."
60,"A Case of Primary Dural Lymphoma: Diffuse Large B-Cell Type."
61,"Primary leptomeningeal lymphoma is very rare disease that is a subtype of primary central nervous system (CNS) lymphoma. Primary dural lymphoma is a subentity of primary leptomeningeal lymphoma and arises from the dura mater without systemic disease. A 47-year-old woman presented with an indolent mass in the right frontal region. The patient's physical examination demonstrated no focal neurological abnormality. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) study revealed a mass lesion in the right frontal region. The patient underwent a right frontal craniectomy and removal of tumor. Histological diagnosis was diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). The patient received chemotherapy with rituximab, cyclophosphamide, adriamycin, vincristine, and prednisolone (R-CHOP protocol) every 3 weeks for six cycles. The patient was discharged without neurological deficit and no evidence of tumor recurrence. There was no systemic dissemination of disease 72 months after the surgery. Until the optimal standard management protocol is established, the treatment should be with an individualized multidisciplinary approach and continued follow-up and clinical surveillance are recommended for every patient."
62,"Cerebral Infarction Caused by Pituitary Apoplexy: Case Report and Review of Literature."
63,"Pituitary apoplexy followed by cerebral infarction is rare. In this report, we present a 42-year-old man who had been diagnosed of pituitary adenoma presented with a sudden onset of unconsciousness, left hemiplegia and right ptosis. Investigations revealed the development of pituitary apoplexy. The extension of tumor mass compressed the supraclinoid portion of the right internal carotid artery, resulting in the cerebral infarction in the right anterior and middle cerebral artery territory. Left anterior cerebral artery territory infarction was also found, which could be caused by vasospasm provoked by pituitary apoplexy. The patient underwent decompression surgery via transsphenoidal approach after four weeks' conservative treatment, and pathological examination revealed hemorrhage and necrosis of the pituitary adenoma. His symptoms improved within five months' follow-up. Since pituitary apoplexy producing cerebral infarction is rare, clinicians should be alert to that possibility, and delayed transsphenoidal surgery following conservative management with steroids is the appropriate management of such an occurrence."
64,"Gross Total Resection of Large Cervical Intramedullary Ependymoma: Demonstration of Microsurgical Techniques."
65,"In adolescents and young adults, ependymomas are the most common intramedullary tumors in the spinal cord.These tumors arise from ependymal cell lining the ventricles and spinal canal. The clinical presentation of intramedullary ependymomas are variable and nonspecific. They usually present with diffuse back or neck pain as a chief complaint. Upper and lower motor neuron deficits, numbness which typically progresses from distal to proximal, are other common symptoms. Gross total resection of ependymomas can achieve long-term tumor control with preservation of function. Here we present a 29-year old man who presented with progressive weakness of the left leg, bowel and bladder incontinence. During surgery, somatosensory evoked potentials (SSEPs) and motor evoked potentials (MEPs) were used and we achieved gross total resection while preserving the spinal cord. The patient made excellent recovery and all of his preoperative deficitis improved completely. He returned to work on postoperative 2-month."
66,"Clinical Results of Anterior Odontoid Screw Fixation for Type II Odontoid Fractures."
67,"AIM: In this study, 31 patients with a diagnosis of Type II odontoid fractures were reported. All patients were treated with anterior transodontoid screw fixation and clinical outcomes were reported. MATERIAL and METHODS: In this study, the retrospective clinical analysis of 31 patients with traumatic type II odontoid fractures who were treated through anterior transodontoid fixation in Neurosurgery Department at VKV American Hospital between 1998 and 2012 was performed. The age, sex, cause of injury, diagnosis time, neurological examination before and after surgery, follow-up period were evaluated. The neurological status of patients was classified according to the Frankel scale. RESULTS: In 4 patients, 2 transodontoid screws were inserted. The mean hospital stay was 3.35 days. Posterior occipito-cervical fusion was done in 1 patient due to the lack of fusion in the first operation. No vascular injury, screw malposition, infection, neurologic deterioration, or complications were observed during the peroperative and postoperative stage. The mean postoperative follow-up period was 36 months after surgery. Radiological imaging of patients were performed at the early and late postoperative stage. CONCLUSION: We found satisfying fusion rates and better patient comfort during the postoperative period. We think that stabilization and fusion through a transodontoid screw is a minimal invasive method."
68,"Choice for the Removal of Bloody Cerebrospinal Fluid in Postcoiling Aneurysmal Subarachnoid Hemorrhage: External Ventricular Drainage or Lumbar Drainage?"
69,"AIM: External ventricular drainage (EVD) and lumbar drainage (LD) are the most widely used procedures for continued bloody cerebrospinal fluid drainage. Each has his own advantages and disadvantages. Here, we compared complications and clinical outcomes in patients with World Federation of Neurosurgical Societies (WFNS) grade III aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH) who underwent coil placement followed by EVD or LD. MATERIAL and METHODS: In this prospective, controlled study, all patients with aSAH classified as WFNS grade III who underwent coil placement at our institution were divided randomly into 2 groups: the EVD group and the LD group. The ratios of intracerebral hemorrhage, vasospasm, infection, duration of catheter placement, hydrocephalus, and Glasgow outcome scale (GOS) after 2 months of onset were analyzed between the 2 groups. RESULTS: A total of 148 patients (mean age 56.8 years) were enrolled in this study. Seventy-six patients were assigned to the EVD group, and 72 patients were assigned to the LD group. The average time interval from stroke onset to surgery was 35.1 h. Compared with the EVD group, the LD group had a lower incidence of intracerebral hemorrhage, slightly higher rates of infection and hydrocephalus, and similar vasospasm and chronic hydrocephalus rates, durations of catheter placement, and GOS scores at 2 months after onset. CONCLUSION: In order to improve the clinical outcomes of patients with aSAH, we suggest that LD is better than EVD for patients with WFNS grade III aSAH who underwent coil placement."
70,"Experience with the Second-Generation Wallis Interspinous Dynamic Stabilization Device Implanted in Degenerative Lumbar Disease: A Case Series of 50 Patients."
71,"AIM: This study aimed to evaluate the short- to medium-term outcomes of the second-generation Wallis interspinous dynamic stabilization device for treatment of lumbar degenerative disease. MATERIAL and METHODS: Fifty patients with lumbar degenerative disease treated from August 2007 to September 2009 were included in this retrospective study. The Japanese Orthopedic Association (JOA) score and the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) were used for therapeutic efficacy evaluation. Odom's criteria were used to evaluate postoperative outcome with regard to symptoms. Anteroposterior X-rays were obtained after surgery. All patients were followed up for 2 years. RESULTS: Based on Odom's criteria, 22, 24 and 4 patients had excellent, good, and fair results respectively. The JOA score at 3, 12, and 24 months after surgery was significantly higher than before surgery (all p < 0.001), and the ODI score at 3, 12, and 24 months after surgery was significantly lower than before surgery (all p < 0.001). The posterior intervertebral disc height and the neural foramina height at 12 and 24 months after surgery was significantly higher than before surgery (both p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Implantation of the second-generation Wallis interspinous dynamic stabilization device produced satisfactory clinical outcome at short- and medium-term follow-up in patients with lumbar degenerative disease."
72,"Balloon-Assisted Endovascular Treatment of Intracranial Dural Arteriovenous Fistulas."
73,"AIM: Most dural arteriovenous fistulas (DAVFs) can be treated safely and effectively with endovascular Onyx embolization. Balloon-assisted endovascular Onyx embolization of intracranial DAVFs is especially suitable for arterial protection and arterial flow reduction in complicated DAVFs. We systemically report our experience in the use of arterial balloon for Onyx embolization of DAVF and evaluate the clinical outcomes. MATERIAL and METHODS: Clinical records of 12 consecutive DAVFs patients (five women, seven men) treated with arterial balloon-assisted endovascular Onyx embolization were retrospectively collected to analysis their presenting symptoms, angiographic features, endovascular treatments, and clinical outcomes. RESULTS: Six patients presented with cortical venous reflux (CVR). Nine patients underwent transarterial (TA) and 3 patients underwent transvenous (TV) embolization. The balloons were used in 3 types of approach: arterial protection in TA embolization, arterial flow reduction in TA embolization and arterial protection in TV approach. Angiograms demonstrated complete obliteration of the fistula in 11 patients and partial occlusion in one. One patient had Onyx embolization-related complication of transient hemi-facial hypoesthesia. CONCLUSION: The Arterial balloon provides protection of intracranial artery and reduction of arterial flow in Onyx embolization of DAVF. This complementary method brought high cure rate."
74,"Idiopathic Scoliosis."
75,"Scoliosis refers to curves exceeding 10 degrees observed through posterioanterior direct radiography. In fact, the diagnosis for idiopathic scoliosis is accepted to exclude already available causes. The aim of this paper was to review the etiopathogenesis, classification systems and the treatment management of idiopathic scoliosis. A search in the National Library of Medicine (Pubmed) database using the key words 'idiopathic' and 'scoliosis' was performed. For the literature review, papers concerning the etiopathogenesis, classification and treatment were selected among these articles. A search in the National Library of Medicine (Pubmed) database using the key words 'idiopathic' and 'scoliosis' yielded 4518 articles published between 1947 and 2013. The main hypothesis put forward included genetic factors, hormonal factors, bone and connective tissue anomalies. King, Lenke, Coonrad and Peking Union Medical College (PUMC) classifications were the main classification systems for idiopathic scoliosis. Exercise, bracing and anterior, posterior or combined surgery when indicated are the choices for the treatment. Every idiopathic scoliosis case has to be managed to its own characteristics. It is the post-operative appearance that the surgeons are perhaps the least interested but the adolescent patients the most interested in. The aim of scoliosis surgery is to restore the spine without neurological deficit."
76,"Efficacy and Safety of Carmustine Wafers in the Treatment of Glioblastoma Multiforme: A Systematic Review."
77,"The aim of this study was to a conduct a systematic review of carmustine wafers (Gliadel wafers) for the treatment of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) to assess the survival benefit and safety of this therapy. The inclusion criteria were 1) prospective or retrospective clinical trial; 2) patients who had undergone resection for primary GBM or first recurrence of GBM with or without carmustine wafer implantation; 3) patients with malignant gliomas that included GBM; 4) outcomes including survival analysis of the GBM population. Six trials met the inclusion criteria; four were randomized, controlled trials and two were retrospective. The trials varied with regard to the type of patients and interventions. In three of the trials, patients with GBM who received carmustine wafers had significantly longer median survival than patients who did not receive wafers. Implantation of carmustine wafers did not significantly improve progression-free survival. Carmustine wafers did not increase adverse effects. This systematic review suggests that carmustine wafers have demonstrated promise as an effective and tolerable treatment in comparison to other treatment strategies in patients with GBM."
78,"Oxidative Stress Is Associated with an Increased Antioxidant Defense in Elderly Subjects: A Multilevel Approach."
79,"BACKGROUND: Studies of associations between plasma GSH-Px activity and cardiovascular risk factors have been done in humans, and contradictory results have been reported. The aim of our study was to assess the association between the scavenger antioxidant enzyme glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) activity in plasma and the presence of novel and classical cardiovascular risk factors in elderly patients. METHODS: We performed a cross-sectional study with baseline data from a subsample of the PREDIMED (PREvencion con DIeta MEDiterranea) study in Spain. Participants were 1,060 asymptomatic subjects at high risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD), aged 55 to 80, selected from 8 primary health care centers (PHCCs). We assessed classical CVD risk factors, plasma oxidized low-density lipoproteins (ox-LDL), and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) using multilevel statistical procedures. RESULTS: Mean GSH-Px value was 612 U/L (SE: 12 U/L), with variation between PHCCs ranging from 549 to 674 U/L (Variance = 1013.5; P<0.001). Between-participants variability within a PHCC accounted for 89% of the total variation. Both glucose and oxidized LDL were positively associated with GSH-Px activity after adjustment for possible confounder variables (P = 0.03 and P = 0.01, respectively). CONCLUSION: In a population at high cardiovascular risk, a positive linear association was observed between plasma GSH-Px activity and both glucose and ox-LDL levels. The high GSH-Px activity observed when an oxidative stress situation occurred, such as hyperglycemia and lipid oxidative damage, could be interpreted as a healthy defensive response against oxidative injury in our cardiovascular risk population."
80,"CTLA4-Ig Preserves Thymus-Derived T Regulatory Cells."
81,"BACKGROUND: CTLA-4 immunoglobulin fusion proteins (CTLA4-Ig) suppress immune reactions by blocking the T-cell costimulatory CD28-CD80-86 pathway and are used in clinical trials for diseases featuring exaggerated T-cell reactivity including autoimmune diseases and allograft rejection. However, because CTLA4-Ig has been suspected to interfere with T regulatory (Treg) cell homeostasis and function, recently, substantial concerns on CTLA4-Ig's potentially antitolerogenic effects have been raised. METHODS: We tested immunoregulatory CTLA4-Ig explicitly for its effect on Treg cell numbers, frequencies and function in an in vitro murine major histocompatibility complex mismatched setting using C57BL/6 bone marrow-derived dendritic cells as stimulators of allogeneic Balb/c Foxp3 T cells, which allowed for tracing Treg cells in a straightforward fashion. RESULTS: The presence of CTLA4-Ig in mixed leukocyte reactions-while dampening the global proliferative response of allostimulated Balb/c T cells-resulted in a relative increase of the frequency of thymus-derived CD4CD25Foxp3 Treg cells with intact suppressive activity. This relative increase was caused by a selective inhibitory effect of CTLA4-Ig on proliferating conventional T cells, whereas the proliferative capacity of Treg cells in cell cultures remained unaffected. Additionally, in the presence of CTLA4-Ig, the frequency of apoptosis was decreased in these cells. CONCLUSION: Our findings unequivocally demonstrate that CTLA4-Ig does not negatively affect Treg cell frequencies and function in vitro."
82,"Association between alcohol-cue modulated startle reactions and drinking behavior in alcohol dependent patients - results of the PREDICT study."
83,"Previous research on alcohol dependent patients has shown that variations in eyeblink startle response can be used as an indicator of their emotional responses to alcohol-related stimuli. Postulating that reactions on substance associated stimuli are controlled by either a negative or a positive affective processing system, we expect that abstinent alcoholics react differently (within-group) in the emotional evaluation of alcohol cues. Furthermore, we assumed the startle response to covary with medication response to acamprosate and naltrexone. We measured 74 detoxified inpatients' acoustic startle responses while they were being presented with alcohol-related images as well as affectively negative, neutral, and positive pictures before they were randomized to pharmacotherapy. Group-mean startle peak amplitudes were lowest for alcohol-related cues. The relative startle response (alcohol cues set in relation to the other stimulus categories) did not correlate with craving for alcohol (OCDS) or alcohol cue induced self-ratings of arousal, valence and craving. Patients with a lower percentage of abstinent days in the 90days prior to the last drinking day showed a lower (""more appetitive"") startle response to alcohol cues. A survival analysis using the time to first heavy drinking day as the survival criterion revealed a significant interaction between alcohol-cue startle responses and medication type. The results indicate that the psycho-physiological measure of emotional evaluation of alcohol cues includes unconscious processing not reflected by conscious self-ratings. Furthermore, our result of a differential medication effect may encourage further studies to use biological characteristics to stratify patients as a step towards individualized treatment for alcohol dependence."
84,"Can Continuous Subcutaneous Insulin Infusion Improve Health-Related Quality of Life in Patients with Shwachman-Bodian-Diamond Syndrome and Diabetes?"
85,"Abstract We report the first case of the use of continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) in a patient with Shwachman-Bodian-Diamond syndrome (SBDS) and diabetes. An Italian boy received diagnosis of SBDS at the age of 7 months (SBDS gene mutation: c.183-184TA-->CT and c.258+2T-->C in compound heterozygous). The patient presented an impaired psychosocial functioning with difficulties in mental health, body pain experiences, attention deficit disorder, somatic complaints, behavioral and social problems. Total Intelligence Quotient (T-IQ) was within the normal range for age (T-IQ=109). The patient developed clinical diabetes at the age of 13 years (glycemia 282 mg/dL at 120 min of oral glucose tolerance test, glycosylated hemoglobin level of 7.5%, anti-beta-cell antibodies negative; glucagon test yielding a C peptide level at zero-time of 1.5 ng/mL and at 6 min of 2.0 ng/mL). Multiple daily injection therapy with insulin was started. Nevertheless, because of a relevant needle phobia and the recurrent hypoglycemia due to poor nutrition secondary to depression, after 3 years the patient started CSII. After 12 months a new evaluation showed (1) better social adaptation, (2) meliorated self-esteem and self-efficacy, (3) reduced psychosocial suffering, and (4) improved health-related quality of life, assessed by the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory version 3.0 Diabetes Module. Thus CSII seems to be crucial to improve health-related quality of life in patients affected by diabetes and genetic disorders."
86,"The complete mitochondrial genome of the spinner shark Carcharhinus brevipinna."
87,"Abstract The mitochondrial genome of the spinner shark (Carcharhinus brevipinna) was determined in this study. It was 16,706 bp in length with the typical genomic organization and gene order as most vertebrates. Whole nucleotide base composition was 31.3% A, 25.3% C, 13.2% G and 30.1% T. Among the protein-coding genes, there are three overlapping reading-frames on the same strand, while one of it on the opposite strand. Two start codons (ATG and GTG) and three stop codons (AGG, TAG and TAA/T) were used in 13 protein-coding genes. The 22 tRNA ranged from 67 (tRNA-Cys and tRNA-Ser2) to 75 bp (tRNA-Leu1) in length. Only the tRNA-Ser2 could not fold into the typical clover-leaf structure, which lost the dihydrouridine (DHU) arm and replaced by a simple loop. The control region was 1064 bp in length and showed a higher AT content (66.8%) than the average value of whole mitogenome (61.4%)."
88,"Circulating microRNAs in patients with polycystic ovary syndrome."
89,"Aim: To explore the pattern of expression of circulating miRNAs in patients with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Materials and methods: Microarray and qRT-PCR were used to investigate circulating miRNAs in PCOS during clinical diagnosis. The targets of dys-regulated miRNAs were predicted using bioinformatics, followed by function and pathway analysis using the databases of Gene Ontology and the KEGG pathway. Results: BMI, triglyceride, HOMA-IR, Testosterone and CRP levels were significantly higher, while estradiol was significantly lower in PCOS than in control groups. After SAM analysis, 5 circulating miRNAs were significantly up-regulated (let-7i-3pm, miR-5706, miR-4463, miR-3665, miR-638) and 4 (miR-124-3p, miR-128, miR-29a-3p, let-7c) were down-regulated in PCOS patients. Hierarchical clustering showed a general distinction between PCOS and control samples in a heat map. After joint prediction by different statistical methods, 34 and 41 genes targeted were up-and down-regulated miRNAs, in PCOS and controls, respectively. Further, GO and KEGG analyses revealed the involvement of the immune system, ATP binding, MAPK signaling, apoptosis, angiogenesis, response to reactive oxygen species and p53 signaling pathways in PCOS. Conclusions: We report a novel non-invasive miRNA profile which distinguishes PCOS patients from healthy controls. The miRNA-target database may provide a novel understanding of PCOS and potential therapeutic targets."
90,"Editorial: Nanoscience Advances in Rheumatology and Immunology."
91,"Improved understanding of the molecular mechanisms leading to autoimmunity have resulted in advances toward the diagnosis, management, and treatment of rheumatologic diseases. Many of these mechanisms overlap with inflammatory disease states and cancer, where nanoscience is increasingly being applied for pharmacologic and diagnostic purposes [1-6]. Additionally, nanoscience has furthered the study of cellular interactions within the in situ environment, thereby increasing the understanding of these complex, multi-system disorders [1, 7-9]. This Hot Topics review series intends to provide an overview of nanoscience, as it pertains to rheumatology and immunology, highlighting emerging technologies applied to rheumatologic models and with the potential for human use. This mini-series has a particular focus on imaging and drug delivery applications pertinent to autoimmune conditions as well as reviewing the pharmacology, clearance, and biodistribution of nanomaterials in inflammatory conditions and by immune cells. Nanotechnology involves the synthesis and utilization of materials - including but not limited to metals, oxides, lipids, polymers -- in the nanoscale range (1 to 1000 nm). Nanomaterial composition as well as the size, shape, charge, and surface coating contribute to unique nanomaterial characteristics that can be used for a variety of biomedical applications [1, 10]. Each of these independent variables influences the application, biodistribution, metabolism, and as anticipated, bystander toxicity. In the current era of biologic and monoclonal antibody-directed therapy for autoimmune disease, clinical and radiographic markers are becoming less sensitive to detect subtle disease activity, and there is an increasing demand for improved diagnostic imaging techniques and contrast agents. Because of the large surface to volume ratio and ease of functionalization, nanoparticles are particularly well suited for advanced imaging [1, 11] and may fill this gap. In the review by Rogers et al., the authors cite several examples of novel nanoparticle-based imaging strategies to identify inflammation and rheumatic disease in the early, pre-clinical stages and even at the cellular level [7, 12, 13]. Coupled with targeted molecular markers, multimodal nanoparticles carrying larger payloads than traditional contrast materials have the ability to increase the sensitivity and specificity of disease monitoring while retaining the anatomic detail of traditional imaging. In addition to the advantages nanomaterials provide as novel contrast agents in imaging, they can also be utilized in vaccination strategies or as drug carriers for targeted delivery to tissues [1, 14, 15]. This technology may improve upon current treatments or could provide therapies for some rheumatic illness, such as systemic lupus erythematosus or scleroderma, for which there are limited therapeutic options. In the review authored by Henderson and colleagues, a wide range of nanoparticle platforms including varied material composition and conjugated strategies are described as approaches to control the processes of drug release, targeted delivery, and degradation [16-19]. There is precedence for FDA approval of nanoparticle-based drug delivery for the treatment of infection and cancer in humans, and in some instances, this has decreased systemic toxicity while improving efficacy [20]. This same balance between targeted therapy and untoward side effects will need to be applied to medications designed for the rheumatic illnesses as the field advances. Many nanomaterials in the living organism are phagocytized by cells of the reticuloendothelial system, and in particular, these include the monocyte/macrophage cellular lineage [21]. In the review by Song et al., the authors discuss the complex interactions between nanoparticles and immune cells since this interplay can affect particle distribution, clearance, and potentially lead to off-target effects such as immune stimulation. Ultimately, these relationships between nanoparticles and immune system activation versus suppression will need to be clarified if their applications extend into treating primary disorders of the immune system such as autoimmunity. In Rheumatology, the role of nanoparticle based imaging, treatment-derived strategies, and pharmacokinetics and biodistribution has largely been conducted in preclinical models. Further in depth studies are needed to translate these exciting findings from animals to patients with rheumatologic or autoimmune conditions. Although some extrapolation can be made from the cancer and infectious disease arena, the chronicity of rheumatic disease will make clarifying the potential effects of nanomaterials in both short- and long-term applications germane to those patients as well as to others with chronic illness."
92,"Chemotherapy or Targeted Therapy as Second-Line Treatment of Advanced Gastric Cancer. A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Published Studies."
93,"Chemotherapy is a cornerstone in treatments of gastric cancer, but despite its benefit, less than 60% of patients receive salvage therapy in clinical practice. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis based on trial data on the role of second-line treatment of advanced gastric cancer. MEDLINE/PubMed and Cochrane Library were searched for randomized phase III trials that compared active therapy to best supportive care in advanced gastric cancer. Data extraction was conducted according to the PRISMA statement. Summary HR for OS was calculated using a hierarchical Bayesian model and subgroup analysis was performed based on baseline Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status (ECOG) performance status (0 vs. 1 or more). A total of 1,407 patients were evaluable for efficacy, 908 were treated in the experimental arms, with chemotherapy (231 pts) or with targeted therapies (677 pts). The risk of death was decreased by 18% (HR = 0.82; 95% CI, 0.79-0.85; posterior probability HR>/=1: <0.00001) with active therapies. Chemotherapy and ramucirumab were able to decrease this risk by 27% and 22%, respectively. No differences were found between chemotherapy and ramucirumab. In patients with ECOG = 0 a greater benefit was found for chemotherapy with a reduction of the risk of death by 43% and no benefits were found for ramucirumab or everolimus. In patients with ECOG = 1 or more a significant reduction of the risk of death by 32% was reported in patients treated with ramucirumab, even if no significant difference was reported between chemotherapy and ramucirumab. This analysis reports that active and available therapies are able to prolong survival in patients with advanced gastric cancer with a different outcome based on initial patient's performance status. New trials based on a better patient stratification are awaited."
94,"Risk Factors for Acute Stroke among South Asians Compared to Other Racial/Ethnic Groups."
95,"BACKGROUND: Studies of racial/ethnic variations in stroke rarely consider the South Asian population, one of the fastest growing sub-groups in the United States. This study compared risk factors for stroke among South Asians with those for whites, African-Americans, and Hispanics. METHODS: Data on 3290 stroke patients were analyzed to examine risk differences among the four racial/ethnic groups. Data on 3290 patients admitted to a regional stroke center were analyzed to examine risk differences for ischemic stroke (including subtypes of small and large vessel disease) among South Asians, whites, African Americans and Hispanics. RESULTS: South Asians were younger and had higher rates of diabetes mellitus, blood pressure, and fasting blood glucose levels than other race/ethnicities. Prevalence of diabetic and antiplatelet medication use, as well as the incidence of small-artery occlusion ischemic stroke was also higher among South Asians. South Asians were almost a decade younger and had comparable socioeconomic levels as whites; however, their stroke risk factors were comparable to that of African Americans and Hispanics. DISCUSSION: Observed differences in stroke may be explained by dietary and life style choices of South Asian-Americans, risk factors that are potentially modifiable. Future population and epidemiologic studies should consider growing ethnic minority groups in the examination of the nature, outcome, and medical care profiles of stroke."
96,"Non-Native (Exotic) Snake Envenomations in the U.S., 2005-2011."
97,"Non-native (exotic) snakes are a problematic source of envenomation worldwide. This manuscript describes the current demographics, outcomes and challenges of non-native snakebites in the United States (U.S.). We performed a retrospective case series of the National Poison Data System (NPDS) database between 2005 and 2011. There were 258 human exposures involving at least 61 unique exotic venomous species (average = 37 per year; range = 33-40). Males comprised 79% and females 21%. The average age was 33 years with 16% less than 20 years old. 70% of bites occurred in a private residence and 86% were treated at a healthcare facility. 35% of cases received antivenom and 10% were given antibiotics. This study is compared to our previous study (1994-2004) in which there was a substantial coding error rate. Software modifications significantly reduced coding errors. Identification and acquisition of appropriate antivenoms pose a number of logistical difficulties in the management of these envenomations. In the U.S., poison centers have valuable systems and clinical roles in the provision of expert consultation and in the management of these cases."
98,"Synthesis, Characterization and In Vitro Study of Biocompatible Cinnamaldehyde Functionalized Magnetite Nanoparticles (CPGF Nps) For Hyperthermia and Drug Delivery Applications in Breast Cancer."
99,"Cinnamaldehyde, the bioactive component of the spice cinnamon, and its derivatives have been shown to possess anti-cancer activity against various cancer cell lines. However, its hydrophobic nature invites attention for efficient drug delivery systems that would enhance the bioavailability of cinnamaldehyde without affecting its bioactivity. Here, we report the synthesis of stable aqueous suspension of cinnamaldehyde tagged Fe3O4 nanoparticles capped with glycine and pluronic polymer (CPGF NPs) for their potential application in drug delivery and hyperthermia in breast cancer. The monodispersed superparamagnetic NPs had an average particulate size of approximately 20 nm. TGA data revealed the drug payload of approximately 18%. Compared to the free cinnamaldehyde, CPGF NPs reduced the viability of breast cancer cell lines, MCF7 and MDAMB231, at lower doses of cinnamaldehyde suggesting its increased bioavailability and in turn its therapeutic efficacy in the cells. Interestingly, the NPs were non-toxic to the non-cancerous HEK293 and MCF10A cell lines compared to the free cinnamaldehyde. The novelty of CPGF nanoparticulate system was that it could induce cytotoxicity in both ER/PR positive/Her2 negative (MCF7) and ER/PR negative/Her2 negative (MDAMB231) breast cancer cells, the latter being insensitive to most of the chemotherapeutic drugs. The NPs decreased the growth of the breast cancer cells in a dose-dependent manner and altered their migration through reduction in MMP-2 expression. CPGF NPs also decreased the expression of VEGF, an important oncomarker of tumor angiogenesis. They induced apoptosis in breast cancer cells through loss of mitochondrial membrane potential and activation of caspase-3. Interestingly, upon exposure to the radiofrequency waves, the NPs heated up to 41.6 degrees C within 1 min, suggesting their promise as a magnetic hyperthermia agent. All these findings indicate that CPGF NPs prove to be potential nano-chemotherapeutic agents in breast cancer."
100,"Distribution of Serotypes, Vaccine Coverage, and Antimicrobial Susceptibility Pattern of Streptococcus Pneumoniae in Children Living in SAARC Countries: A Systematic Review."
101,"INTRODUCTION: Each SAARC nation falls in the zone of high incidence of pneumococcal disease but there is a paucity of literature estimating the burden of pneumococcal disease in this region. OBJECTIVE: To identify the prevalent serotypes causing invasive pneumococcal disease in children of SAARC countries, to determine the coverage of these serotypes by the available vaccines, and to determine the antibiotic resistance pattern of Streptococcus pneumoniae. METHODS: We searched major electronic databases using a comprehensive search strategy, and additionally searched the bibliography of the included studies and retrieved articles till July 2014. Both community and hospital based observational studies which included children aged </=12 years as/or part of the studied population in SAARC countries were included. RESULTS: A total of 17 studies were included in the final analysis. The period of surveillance varied from 12-96 months (median, 24 months). The most common serotypes country-wise were as follows: serotype 1 in Nepal; serotype 14 in Bangladesh and India; serotype 19F in Sri Lanka and Pakistan. PCV-10 was found to be suitable for countries like India, Nepal, Bangladesh, and Sri Lanka, whereas PCV-13 may be more suitable for Pakistan. An increasing trend of non-susceptibility to antibiotics was noted for co-trimoxazole, erythromycin and chloramphenicol, whereas an increasing trend of susceptibility was noted for penicillin. CONCLUSION: Due to paucity of recent data in majority of the SAARC countries, urgent large size prospective studies are needed to formulate recommendations for specific pneumococcal vaccine introduction and usage of antimicrobial agents in these regions."
102,"Effects of Human Parvovirus B19 and Bocavirus VP1 Unique Region on Tight Junction of Human Airway Epithelial A549 Cells."
103,"As is widely recognized, human parvovirus B19 (B19) and human bocavirus (HBoV) are important human pathogens. Obviously, both VP1 unique region (VP1u) of B19 and HBoV exhibit the secreted phospholipase A2 (sPLA2)-like enzymatic activity and are recognized to participate in the pathogenesis of lower respiratory tract illnesses. However, exactly how, both VP1u from B19 and HBoV affect tight junction has seldom been addressed. Therefore, this study investigates how B19-VP1u and HBoV-VP1u may affect the tight junction of the airway epithelial A549 cells by examining phospholipase A2 activity and transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) as well as performing immunoblotting analyses. Experimental results indicate that TEER is more significantly decreased in A549 cells by treatment with TNF-alpha (10 ng), two dosages of B19-VP1u and BoV-VP1u (400 ng and 4000 ng) or bee venom PLA2 (10 ng) than that of the control. Accordingly, more significantly increased claudin-1 and decreased occludin are detected in A549 cells by treatment with TNF-alpha or both dosages of HBoV-VP1u than that of the control. Additionally, more significantly decreased Na+/K+ ATPase is observed in A549 cells by treatment with TNF-alpha, high dosage of B19-VP1u or both dosages of BoV-VP1u than that of the control. Above findings suggest that HBoV-VP1u rather than B19 VP1u likely plays more important roles in the disruption of tight junction in the airway tract. Meanwhile, this discrepancy appears not to be associated with the secreted phospholipase A2 (sPLA2)-like enzymatic activity."
104,"Proton Pump Inhibitors and Hospitalization with Hypomagnesemia: A Population-Based Case-Control Study."
105,"BACKGROUND: Some evidence suggests that proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are an under-appreciated risk factor for hypomagnesemia. Whether hospitalization with hypomagnesemia is associated with use of PPIs is unknown. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We conducted a population-based case-control study of multiple health care databases in Ontario, Canada, from April 2002 to March 2012. Patients who were enrolled as cases were Ontarians aged 66 years or older hospitalized with hypomagnesemia. For each individual enrolled as a case, we identified up to four individuals as controls matched on age, sex, kidney disease, and use of various diuretic classes. Exposure to PPIs was categorized according to the most proximate prescription prior to the index date as current (within 90 days), recent (within 91 to 180 days), or remote (within 181 to 365 days). We used conditional logistic regression to estimate the odds ratio for the association of outpatient PPI use and hospitalization with hypomagnesemia. To test the specificity of our findings we examined use of histamine H2 receptor antagonists, drugs with no causal link to hypomagnesemia. We studied 366 patients hospitalized with hypomagnesemia and 1,464 matched controls. Current PPI use was associated with a 43% increased risk of hypomagnesemia (adjusted odds ratio, 1.43; 95% CI 1.06-1.93). In a stratified analysis, the risk was particularly increased among patients receiving diuretics, (adjusted odds ratio, 1.73; 95% CI 1.11-2.70) and not significant among patients not receiving diuretics (adjusted odds ratio, 1.25; 95% CI 0.81-1.91). We estimate that one excess hospitalization with hypomagnesemia will occur among 76,591 outpatients treated with a PPI for 90 days. Hospitalization with hypomagnesemia was not associated with the use of histamine H2 receptor antagonists (adjusted odds ratio 1.06; 95% CI 0.54-2.06). Limitations of this study include a lack of access to serum magnesium levels, uncertainty regarding diagnostic coding of hypomagnesemia, and generalizability of our findings to younger patients. CONCLUSIONS: PPIs are associated with a small increased risk of hospitalization with hypomagnesemia among patients also receiving diuretics. Physicians should be aware of this association, particularly for patients with hypomagnesemia. Please see later in the article for the Editors' Summary."
106,"Testosterone Trajectories and Reference Ranges in a Large Longitudinal Sample of Male Adolescents."
107,"PURPOSE: Pubertal dynamics plays an important role in physical and psychological development of children and adolescents. We aim to provide reference ranges of plasma testosterone in a large longitudinal sample. Furthermore, we describe a measure of testosterone trajectories during adolescence that can be used in future investigations of development. METHODS: We carried out longitudinal measurements of plasma testosterone in 2,216 samples obtained from 513 males (9 to 17 years of age) from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children. We used integration of a model fitted to each participant's testosterone trajectory to calculate a measure of average exposure to testosterone over adolescence. We pooled these data with corresponding values reported in the literature to provide a reference range of testosterone levels in males between the ages of 6 and 19 years. RESULTS: The average values of total testosterone in the ALSPAC sample range from 0.82 nmol/L (Standard Deviation [SD]: 0.09) at 9 years of age to 16.5 (SD: 2.65) nmol/L at 17 years of age; these values are congruent with other reports in the literature. The average exposure to testosterone is associated with different features of testosterone trajectories such as Peak Testosterone Change, Age at Peak Testosterone Change, and Testosterone at 17 years of age as well as the timing of the growth spurt during puberty. CONCLUSIONS: The average exposure to testosterone is a useful measure for future investigations using testosterone trajectories to examine pubertal dynamics."
108,"The interplay between inflammatory cytokines and the endocannabinoid system in the regulation of synaptic transmission."
109,"Excessive glutamate-mediated synaptic transmission and secondary excitotoxicity have been proposed as key determinants of neurodegeneration in many neurological diseases. Soluble mediators of inflammation have recently gained attention owing to their ability to enhance glutamate transmission and affect synaptic sensitivity to neurotransmitters. In the complex crosstalk between soluble immunoactive molecules and synapses, the endocannabinoid system (ECS) plays a central role, exerting an indirect neuroprotective action by inhibiting cytokine-dependent synaptic alterations, and a direct neuroprotective effect by limiting glutamate transmission and excitotoxic damage. On the other hand, the endocannabinoid (eCB)-mediated control of synaptic transmission is altered by proinflammatory cytokines with consequent effects in central nervous system (CNS) disorders. In this review, we summarize the interactions, at the pre- and postsynaptic level, between major inflammatory cytokines and the ECS. In addition, the behavioral and clinical consequences of the modulation of synaptic transmission during neuroinflammation are discussed."
110,"Hepatic Resection Is Safe and Effective for Patients with Hepatocellular Carcinoma and Portal Hypertension."
111,"BACKGROUND & AIMS: Official guidelines do not recommend hepatic resection (HR) for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and portal hypertension (PHT). This study aims to investigate the safety and efficacy of HR for patients with HCC and PHT. METHODS: Mortality and survival after HR were analyzed retrospectively in a consecutive sample of 1738 HCC patients with PHT (n = 386) or without it (n = 1352). To assess the robustness of findings, we repeated the analysis using propensity score-matched analysis. We also comprehensively searched the PubMed database for studies evaluating the efficacy and safety of HR for patients with HCC and PHT. RESULTS: The 90-day mortality rate was 6.7% among those with PHT and 2.1% among those without it (P<.001). Patients without PHT had a survival benefit over those with PHT at 1, 3, and 5 years (96% vs 90%, 75% vs 67%, 54% vs 45%, respectively; P = .001). In contrast, PHT was not associated with worse short- or long-term survival when only propensity score-matched pairs of patients and those with early-stage HCC or those who underwent minor hepatectomy were included in the analysis (all P>.05). Moreover, the recurrence rates were similar between the two groups. Consistent with our findings, all 9 studies identified in our literature search reported HR to be safe and effective for patients with HCC and PHT. CONCLUSIONS: HR is safe and effective in HCC patients with PHT and preserved liver function. This is especially true for patients who have early-stage HCC or who undergo minor hepatectomy."
112,"A Suitable Streptomycin-Resistant Mutant for Constructing Unmarked In-Frame Gene Deletions Using rpsL as a Counter-Selection Marker."
113,"The streptomycin counter-selection system is a useful tool for constructing unmarked in-frame gene deletions, which is a fundamental approach to study bacteria and their pathogenicity at the molecular level. A prerequisite for this system is acquiring a streptomycin-resistant strain due to rpsL mutations, which encodes the ribosomal protein S12. However, in this study no streptomycin resistance was found to be caused by rpsL mutations in all 127 clinical strains of Klebsiella pneumoniae isolated from liver abscess patients. By screening 107 spontaneous mutants of streptomycin resistance from a clinical strain of K. pneumoniae, nucleotide substitution or insertion located within the rpsL was detected in each of these strains. Thirteen different mutants with varied S12 proteins were obtained, including nine streptomycin-dependent mutants. The virulence of all four streptomycin-resistant mutants was further evaluated. Compared with the parental strain, the K42N, K42T and K87R mutants showed a reduction in growth rate, and the K42N and K42T mutants became susceptible to normal human serum. In the mice LD50 (the bacterial dose that caused 50% death) assay, the K42N and K42T mutants were approximately 1,000-fold less lethal ( approximately 2x105 CFU) and the K87R mutant was approximately 50-fold less lethal ( approximately 1x104 CFU) than the parental strain ( approximately 2x102 CFU). A K42R mutant showed non-observable effects on the above assays, while this mutant exhibited a small cost (P<0.01) in an in vitro growth competition experiment. In summary, most of the K. pneumoniae strains with streptomycin resistance caused by rpsL mutations are less virulent than their parental strain in the absence of streptomycin. The K42R mutant showed similar pathogenicity to its parental strain and should be one of the best choices when using rpsL as a counter-selection marker."
114,"Association between Combined Lifestyle Factors and Non-Restorative Sleep in Japan: A Cross-Sectional Study Based on a Japanese Health Database."
115,"BACKGROUND: Although lifestyle factors such as cigarette smoking, excessive drinking, obesity, low or no exercise, and unhealthy dietary habits have each been associated with inadequate sleep, little is known about their combined effect. The aim of this study was to quantify the overall impact of lifestyle-related factors on non-restorative sleep in the general Japanese population. METHODS AND FINDINGS: A cross-sectional study of 243,767 participants (men, 39.8%) was performed using the Specific Health Check and Guidance System in Japan. A healthy lifestyle score was calculated by adding up the number of low-risk lifestyle factors for each participant. Low risk was defined as (1) not smoking, (2) body mass index<25 kg/m2, (3) moderate or less alcohol consumption, (4) regular exercise, and (5) better eating patterns. Logistic regression analysis was used to examine the relationship between the score and the prevalence of non-restorative sleep, which was determined from questionnaire responses. Among 97,062 men (mean age, 63.9 years) and 146,705 women (mean age, 63.7 years), 18,678 (19.2%) and 38,539 (26.3%) reported non-restorative sleep, respectively. The prevalence of non-restorative sleep decreased with age for both sexes. Compared to participants with a healthy lifestyle score of 5 (most healthy), those with a score of 0 (least healthy) had a higher prevalence of non-restorative sleep (odds ratio, 1.59 [95% confidence interval, 1.29-1.97] for men and 2.88 [1.74-4.76] for women), independently of hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, diabetes, and chronic kidney disease. The main limitation of the study was the cross-sectional design, which limited causal inferences for the identified associations. CONCLUSIONS: A combination of several unhealthy lifestyle factors was associated with non-restorative sleep among the general Japanese population. Further studies are needed to establish whether general lifestyle modification improves restorative sleep."
116,"The role of FeS clusters for molybdenum cofactor biosynthesis and molybdoenzymes in bacteria."
117,"Molybdenum is the only second row transition metal essential for biological systems, which is biologically available as molybdate ion. In eukarya, bacteria and archaea, molybdenum is bound to either to a tricyclic pyranopterin, thereby forming the molybdenum cofactor (Moco), or in some bacteria to the FeS cluster based iron-molybdenum cofactor (FeMoco), which forms the active site of nitrogenase. To date more than 50 Moco-containing enzymes have been purified and biochemically or structurally characterized. The physiological role of molybdenum in these enzymes is fundamental to organisms, since the reactions include the catalysis of key steps in carbon, nitrogen and sulfur metabolism. The catalyzed reactions are in most cases oxo-transfer reactions or the hydroxylation of carbon centers. The biosynthesis of Moco has been intensively studied, in addition to its insertion into molybdoenzymes. In particular, a link between the biosynthesis and maturation of molybdoenzymes and the biosynthesis and distribution of FeS clusters has been identified in the last years: 1) The synthesis of the first intermediate in Moco biosynthesis requires an FeS-cluster containing protein, 2) The sulfurtransferase for the dithiolene group in Moco is common also for the synthesis of FeS clusters, thiamin and thiolated tRNAs, 3) the modification of the active site with a sulfur atom additionally involves a sulfurtransferase, 4) most molybdoenzymes in bacteria require FeS clusters as additional redox active cofactors. In this review we will focus on the biosynthesis of the molybdenum cofactor in bacteria, its modification and insertion into molybdoenzymes, with an emphasis to its link to FeS cluster biosynthesis and sulfur transfer. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled: Fe/S proteins: Analysis, structure, function, biogenesis and diseases."
118,"Decline in cellular clearance systems induces inflammasome signaling in human ARPE-19 cells."
119,"Retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) plays a major role in the maintenance of photoreceptors, and degeneration of RPE results in the development of age-related macular degeneration (AMD). Accumulation of intracellular protein aggregates, increased oxidative stress, and chronic inflammation are all factors damaging the functionality of aged RPE cells. Here, we report that inhibition of proteasomal degradation with MG-132 and autophagy with bafilomycin A1 resulted in the release of IL-1beta but not that of IL-18 in human ARPE-19 cells. NLRP3 receptor became upregulated, and caspase-1, the functional component of an inflammasome complex, was activated. In addition to accumulating intracellular protein aggregates, inhibition of degradation systems induced oxidative stress which was demonstrated by elevated amounts of intracellular 4-hydroxynonenal (HNE)-protein adducts. Along with IL-1beta, exposure to MG-132 and bafilomycin A1 resulted in the secretion of IL-8. A low concentration (1pg/ml) of IL-1beta was capable of triggering significant IL-8 production which also became attenuated by treatment with a specific caspase-1 inhibitor. These results suggest that decline in intracellular degradation systems results not only in increased amounts of intracellular protein aggregates and oxidative stress but also in the activation of NLRP3 inflammasomes, arisen as a result of elevated production of biologically active IL-1beta."
120,"miR-34a Inhibits Migration and Invasion of Tongue Squamous Cell Carcinoma via Targeting MMP9 and MMP14."
121,"BACKGROUND: miR-34a is an important tumor suppressor gene in various cancer types. But little is known about the dysregulation of miR-34a in tongue squamous cell carcinoma (TSCC). In this study, we investigate the expression and potential role of miR-34a in TSCC. METHODS: We evaluated miR-34a expression and its relationship with clinicopathological characters in 75 pairs of TSCC samples, and confirmed the role of miR-34a for predicting lymph node metastases from a further 15 pairs of paraffin-embedded TSCC specimens with stringent clinicopathological recruitment criteria using quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). The effects of miR-34a on cell proliferation, migration and invasion were examined in TSCC cell lines using Cell Counting Kit-8 assay, wound healing assay and transwell assay, respectively. The effects of miR-34a on the expression of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) 9 and 14 were detected by luciferase reporter assays and Western blot analysis. The expression of miR-34a, MMP9 and MMP14 were also confirmed in TSCC samples by in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: miR-34a expression in tumor tissues from TSCC patients with positive lymph node metastases was significantly lower than that with negative lymph node metastases. Overexpression of miR-34a significantly suppressed migration and invasion in TSCC cells and simultaneously inhibited the expression of MMP9 and MMP14 through targeting the coding region and the 3'untranslated region, respectively. Moreover, miR-34a expression in TSCC was inversely correlated with protein expression of MMP9 and MMP14 in the TSCC samples. CONCLUSIONS: miR-34a plays an important role in lymph node metastases of TSCC through targeting MMP9 and MMP14 and may have potential applications in prognosis prediction and gene therapy for lymph node metastases of TSCC patients."
122,"Carotid Intima-Media Thickness Is Predicted by Combined Eotaxin Levels and Severity of Hepatic Steatosis at Ultrasonography in Obese Patients with Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease."
123,"BACKGROUND: Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) is a distinct coronary artery disease (CAD) risk factor. The atherosclerotic process predisposing to CAD includes altered lipid profile and inflammatory processes. The available evidence suggests that increased circulating levels of eotaxin, an eosinophil chemoattractant cytokine implicated in allergic responses, are detected in the serum of patients with CAD. Relationships were sought between serum eotaxin on the one hand, and intima-media thickness-an early predictor of the atherosclerotic process, hepatic steatosis, arterial blood pressure values, as well as inflammation/immune markers and angiogenetic factors-on the other. METHODS: Eighty obese patients with NAFLD, diagnosed at ultrasonography, without evident cytolysis, formed our study population. Anthropometric measures, metabolic profile, serum concentrations of interleukin-1beta, C-reactive protein, interleukin-6, fibrinogen, ferritin, TNF-alpha, spleen size, vascular endothelial growth factor, platelet-derived growth factor-BB and heat shock protein-70 were evaluated. RESULTS: Serum eotaxin concentrations were distinctly associated with TNF alpha, IL-6, IL-1beta, VEGF and PDGF-BB levels but not with CRP, fibrinogen, heat shock protein-70 or spleen size. Among the metabolic and anthropometric parameters, a significant predictive power emerged when comparing eotaxin to insulin resistance, expressed as HOMA. NAFLD was distinctly associated with HOMA (P = 0.0005). Intima-media thickness was well predicted by both eotaxin levels and severity of NAFLD at ultrasonography, although no relation was detected between these last two variables. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: A role for insulin resistance in mediating the interplay between eotaxin and other inflammation/immune parameters could be evidenced in the induction/maintenance of atherosclerosis of obese patients with NAFLD."
124,"Factors predicting the total medical costs associated with first-ever ischemic stroke patients transferred to the rehabilitation ward."
125,"Objective: To investigate the predictors of total medical costs for first-ever ischaemic stroke patients transferred to the rehabilitation ward from the acute ward. Patients: A total of 311 first-ever ischaemic stroke patients (mean age 68.9 (standard deviation (SD) 12.2) years). Methods: Data, including common complications and medical events, from July 2002 to June 2012 were collected retrospectively from a regional hospital in Taiwan in order to study the potential predictors for medical costs. Significant variables from univariate analysis were included in a stepwise multivariate linear regression analysis. Results: The mean total medical cost per patient was USD 4,606.80 (SD 2,926.10). The significant predictors for cost were days of total stay (coefficient: 70.3; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 56.4-84.3), impaired consciousness (coefficient: 1,031.3; 95% CI = 490.8-1,571.8), hypoalbuminaemia in the acute ward (coefficient: 2,045.1; 95% CI = 1,054.6-3,035.7), fever (coefficient: 927.0; 95% CI = 193.3-1,660.7), hypokalaemia (coefficient: 2,698.4; 95% CI = 660.5-4,736.4), and hyponatraemia (coefficient: 1,123.3; 95% CI = 72.2-2,174.5) in the rehabilitation ward (R2 = 0.416). Conclusion: These findings can help clinicians to identify risk factors for total medical costs in these patients and reduce costs by minimizing some complications (hypoalbuminaemia, fever, hypokalaemia, and hyponatraemia)."
126,"Cocaine self-administration causes signaling deficits in corticostriatal circuitry that are reversed by BDNF in early withdrawal."
127,"Cocaine self-administration disturbs intracellular signaling in prefrontal cortical neurons that regulate neurotransmission in the nucleus accumbens. The deficits in dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC) signaling change over time, resulting in different neuroadaptations during early withdrawal from cocaine self-administration than after one or more weeks of abstinence. Within the first few hours of withdrawal, there is a marked decrease in tyrosine phosphorylation of critical intracellular and membrane-bound proteins in the dmPFC that include ERK/MAP kinase and the NMDA receptor subunits, GluN1 and GluN2B. These changes are accompanied by a marked increase in STEP tyrosine phosphatase activation. Simultaneously, ERK and PKA-dependent synapsin phosphorylation in presynaptic terminals of the nucleus accumbens is increased that may have a destabilizing impact on glutamatergic transmission. Infusion of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) into the dmPFC immediately following a final session of cocaine self-administration blocks the cocaine-induced changes in phosphorylation and attenuates relapse to cocaine seeking for as long as three weeks. The intra-dmPFC BDNF infusion also prevents cocaine-induced deficits in prefronto-accumbens glutamatergic transmission that are implicated in cocaine seeking. Thus, intervention with BDNF in the dmPFC during early withdrawal has local and distal effects in target areas that are critical to mediating cocaine-induced neuroadaptations that lead to cocaine seeking."
128,"Evolution of the miR-290-295/miR-371-373 Cluster Family Seed Repertoire."
129,"Expression of the mouse miR-290-295 cluster and its miR-371-373 homolog in human is restricted to early embryos, primordial germ cells, the germ line stem cell compartment of the adult testis and to stem cell lines derived from the early embryonic lineages. Sequencing data suggest considerable seed diversification between the seven homologous pre-miRNAs of miR-290-295 but it is not clear if all of the implied miR-290-295 seeds are also conserved in the human miR-371-373 cluster, which consists of only three homologous pre-miRNAs. By employing miRNA target reporters we show that most, if not all, seeds in miR-290-295 are represented in miR-371-373. In the mouse, pre-miR-290, pre-miR-292 and pre-miR-293 express subsets of the miRNA isoforms processed from the single human pre-miR-371. Comparison of the possible miR-290-295/miR-371-373 seed repertoires in placental mammals suggests a model for the evolution of this miRNA cluster family, which would be otherwise difficult to deduce based solely on pre-miRNA sequence comparisons. The conservation of co-expressed seeds that is characteristic of miR-290-295/miR-371-373 should be taken into account in models of the corresponding miRNA-target interaction networks."
130,"Detection and Characterization of Cancer Cells and Pathogenic Bacteria Using Aptamer-Based Nano-Conjugates."
131,"Detection and characterization of cells using aptamers and aptamer-conjugated nanoprobes has evolved a great deal over the past few decades. This evolution has been driven by the easy selection of aptamers via in vitro cell-SELEX, permitting sensitive discrimination between target and normal cells, which includes pathogenic prokaryotic and cancerous eukaryotic cells. Additionally, when the aptamer-based strategies are used in conjunction with nanomaterials, there is the potential for cell targeting and therapeutic effects with improved specificity and sensitivity. Here we review recent advances in aptamer-based nano-conjugates and their applications for detecting cancer cells and pathogenic bacteria. The multidisciplinary research utilized in this field will play an increasingly significant role in clinical medicine and drug discovery."
132,"Validating and Calibrating the Nintendo Wii Balance Board to Derive Reliable Center of Pressure Measures."
133,"The Nintendo Wii balance board (WBB) has generated significant interest in its application as a postural control measurement device in both the clinical and (basic, clinical, and rehabilitation) research domains. Although the WBB has been proposed as an alternative to the ""gold standard"" laboratory-grade force plate, additional research is necessary before the WBB can be considered a valid and reliable center of pressure (CoP) measurement device. In this study, we used the WBB and a laboratory-grade AMTI force plate (AFP) to simultaneously measure the CoP displacement of a controlled dynamic load, which has not been done before. A one-dimensional inverted pendulum was displaced at several different displacement angles and load heights to simulate a variety of postural sway amplitudes and frequencies (<1 Hz). Twelve WBBs were tested to address the issue of inter-device variability. There was a significant effect of sway amplitude, frequency, and direction on the WBB's CoP measurement error, with an increase in error as both sway amplitude and frequency increased and a significantly greater error in the mediolateral (ML) (compared to the anteroposterior (AP)) sway direction. There was no difference in error across the 12 WBB's, supporting low inter-device variability. A linear calibration procedure was then implemented to correct the WBB's CoP signals and reduce measurement error. There was a significant effect of calibration on the WBB's CoP signal accuracy, with a significant reduction in CoP measurement error (quantified by root-mean-squared error) from 2-6 mm (before calibration) to 0.5-2 mm (after calibration). WBB-based CoP signal calibration also significantly reduced the percent error in derived (time-domain) CoP sway measures, from -10.5% (before calibration) to -0.05% (after calibration) (percent errors averaged across all sway measures and in both sway directions). In this study, we characterized the WBB's CoP measurement error under controlled, dynamic conditions and implemented a linear calibration procedure for WBB CoP signals that is recommended to reduce CoP measurement error and provide more reliable estimates of time-domain CoP measures. Despite our promising results, additional work is necessary to understand how our findings translate to the clinical and rehabilitation research domains. Once the WBB's CoP measurement error is fully characterized in human postural sway (which differs from our simulated postural sway in both amplitude and frequency content), it may be used to measure CoP displacement in situations where lower accuracy and precision is acceptable."
134,"A Sensorized Nuss Bar for Patient-Specific Treatment of Pectus Excavatum."
135,"Pectus Excavatum is an anatomical deformation characterized by a depression of the anterior chest wall. Nuss technique (representing the current clinical golden standard) consists in the introduction of a corrective metal bar, in order to raise the sternum in its anatomic natural position. Nowadays, the bar plays purely a mechanical/corrective action and is kept implanted for about three years, supporting up to a maximum force of 250 N. Our study aims at optimizing the procedure of correction, in terms of monitoring the bar effect, minimizing the body response, and facilitating the bar removal. The sensorized Nuss bar prototype inserted in a platform for telemedicine described in this article is able to monitor in vitro pressure data variations, with more than 150 discrete measurements during the operating period. This behavior is promising for future clinical applications, in which the device could be exploited to monitor the forces at work, thus, providing a customized therapeutic protocol, which in turn may optimize the period of implant. The sensorized bar was also provided with a polymeric coating, able to influence human dermal fibroblast behavior in vitro. This highlights the possibility to minimize, in future in vivo applications, tissue fibrotic responses."
136,"Changes in Catastrophizing and Depressed Mood During and After Early Cognitive Behaviorally Oriented Interventions for Pain."
137,"Catastrophizing and depressed mood are risk factors for poor outcome in treatments for pain and appear to act as mediators for favorable outcome. However, little is known about how catastrophizing and depressed mood co-occur within individuals and how these patterns change during treatment, which is the focus of the current study. The study uses data from a randomized controlled trial about early cognitive behaviorally oriented interventions for patients with nonspecific spinal pain (N = 84). Cluster analyses were used to extract subgroups of individuals with similar scoring patterns on catastrophizing and depressed mood at pretreatment, mid-treatment, posttreatment, and at 6 months' follow-up. To track individual progress, the clusters were linked over time. The analyses revealed four clusters: ""low depression and catastrophizing"", ""high depression and catastrophizing"", ""high depression"", and ""high catastrophizing"". There was little individual transition from one scoring pattern to another across time, not at least for those scoring high on both depressed mood and catastrophizing. Moreover, high stability within this cluster was related to low levels of psychological flexibility at baseline. It is concluded that catastrophizing and depressed mood at the start of treatment were likely to remain high despite a cognitive behavioral intervention and that a lack of psychological flexibility may have a role."
138,"Association between DAPK1 Promoter Methylation and Cervical Cancer: A Meta-Analysis."
139,"BACKGROUND: Death-associated protein kinase1 (DAPK1) is an important tumor suppressor gene. DNA methylation can inactivate genes, which has often been observed in the carcinogenesis of cervical cancer. During the past several decades, many studies have explored the association between DAPK1 promoter methylation and cervical cancer. However, many studies were limited by the small samples size and the findings were inconsistent among them. Thus, we conducted a meta-analysis to assess the association between DAPK1 promoter methylation and cervical cancer. METHODS: We systematically searched eligible studies in the PubMed, Web of Science, EMBASE and CNKI databases. Using meta-regression, subgroup analysis and sensitivity analysis, we explored the potential sources of heterogeneity. The odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (95% CI) were calculated by Meta-Analysis in R. RESULTS: A total of 15 studies from 2001 to 2012, comprising 818 tumor tissues samples and 671 normal tissues samples, were analyzed in this meta-analysis. The frequencies of DAPK1 promoter methylation ranged from 30.0% to 78.6% (median, 59.3%) in cervical cancer tissue and 0.0% to 46.7% (median, 7.8%) in normal cervical tissue. The pooled OR was 19.66 (95%CI = 8.72-44.31) with the random effects model, and heterogeneity was found through the sensitivity analysis. The I2 = 60% (P = 0.002) decreased to I2 = 29.2% (P = 0.144) when one heterogeneous study was excluded, and the pooled OR increased to 21.80 (95%CI = 13.44-35.36) with the fixed effects model. CONCLUSION: The results suggested a strong association between DAPK1 promoter methylation and cervical cancer. This study also indicated that DAPK1 promoter methylation may be a biomarker during cervical carcinogenesis that might serve as an early indication of cervical cancer."
140,"Retention and Risk Factors for Attrition in a Large Public Health ART Program in Myanmar: A Retrospective Cohort Analysis."
141,"BACKGROUND: The outcomes from an antiretroviral treatment (ART) program within the public sector in Myanmar have not been reported. This study documents retention and the risk factors for attrition in a large ART public health program in Myanmar. METHODS: A retrospective analysis of a cohort of adult patients enrolled in the Integrated HIV Care (IHC) Program between June 2005 and October 2011 and followed up until April 2012 is presented. The primary outcome was attrition (death or loss-follow up); a total of 10,223 patients were included in the 5-year cumulative survival analysis. Overall 5,718 patients were analyzed for the risk factors for attrition using both logistic regression and flexible parametric survival models. RESULT: The mean age was 36 years, 61% of patients were male, and the median follow up was 13.7 months. Overall 8,564 (84%) patients were retained in ART program: 750 (7%) were lost to follow-up and 909 (9%) died. During the 3 years follow-up, 1,542 attritions occurred over 17,524 person years at risk, giving an incidence density of 8.8% per year. The retention rates of participants at 12, 24, 36, 48 and 60 months were 86, 82, 80, 77 and 74% respectively. In multivariate analysis, being male, having high WHO staging, a low CD4 count, being anaemic or having low BMI at baseline were independent risk factors for attrition; tuberculosis (TB) treatment at ART initiation, a prior ART course before program enrollment and literacy were predictors for retention in the program. CONCLUSION: High retention rate of IHC program was documented within the public sector in Myanmar. Early diagnosis of HIV, nutritional support, proper investigation and treatment for patients with low CD4 counts and for those presenting with anaemia are crucial issues towards improvement of HIV program outcomes in resource-limited settings."
142,"An evidence-based method for examining and reporting cognitive processes in nutrition research."
143,"Cognitive outcomes are frequently implemented as endpoints in nutrition research. To reduce the number of statistical comparisons it is commonplace for nutrition researchers to combine cognitive test results into a smaller number of broad cognitive abilities. However, there is a clear lack of understanding and consensus as to how best execute this practice. The present paper reviews contemporary models of human cognition and proposes a standardised, evidence-based method for grouping cognitive test data into broader cognitive abilities. Both Carroll's model of human cognitive ability and the Cattell-Horn-Carroll (CHC) model of intelligence provide empirically based taxonomies of human cognition. These models provide a cognitive 'map' that can be used to guide the handling and analysis of cognitive outcomes in nutrition research. Making use of a valid cognitive nomenclature can provide the field of clinical nutrition with a common cognitive language enabling efficient comparisons of cognitive outcomes across studies. This will make it easier for researchers, policymakers and readers to interpret and compare cognitive outcomes for different interventions. Using an empirically derived cognitive nomenclature to guide the creation of cognitive composite scores will ensure that cognitive endpoints are theoretically valid and meaningful. This will increase the generalisability of trial results to the general population. The present review also discusses how the CHC model of cognition can also guide the synthesis of cognitive outcomes in systematic reviews and meta-analysis."
144,"Contribution of Psychosocial Factors to the Association between Socioeconomic Position and Takeaway Food Consumption."
145,"OBJECTIVE: To examine whether psychosocial factors mediate (explain) the association between socioeconomic position and takeaway food consumption. DESIGN: A cross-sectional postal survey conducted in 2009. SETTING: Participants reported their usual consumption of 22 takeaway food items, and these were grouped into a ""healthy"" and ""less healthy"" index based on each items' nutritional properties. Principal Components Analysis was used to derive three psychosocial scales that measured beliefs about the relationship between diet and health (alpha = 0.73), and perceptions about the value (alpha = 0.79) and pleasure (alpha = 0.61) of takeaway food. A nutrition knowledge index was also used. Socioeconomic position was measured by highest attained education level. SUBJECTS: Randomly selected adults (n = 1,500) aged between 25-64 years in Brisbane, Australia (response rate = 63.7%, N = 903). RESULTS: Compared with those with a bachelor degree or higher, participants with a diploma level of education were more likely to consume ""healthy"" takeaway food (p = 0.023) whereas the least educated (high school only) were more likely to consume ""less healthy"" choices (p = 0.002). The least educated were less likely to believe in a relationship between diet and health (p<0.001), and more likely to have lower nutritional knowledge compared with their highly educated counterparts (p<0.001). Education differences in beliefs about the relationship between diet and health partly and significantly mediated the association between education and ""healthy"" takeaway food consumption. Diet- and health-related beliefs and nutritional knowledge partly and significantly mediated the education differences in ""less healthy"" takeaway food consumption. CONCLUSIONS: Interventions that target beliefs about the relationship between diet and health, and nutritional knowledge may reduce socioeconomic differences in takeaway food consumption, particularly for ""less healthy"" options."
146,"Long-term follow-up of adult men born with hypospadias: Urological and cosmetic results."
147,"PURPOSE: To present data on long-term functional and cosmetic results after hypospadias surgery. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Men > 18 years of age with hypospadias treated in Sweden were asked to participate in the study as well as age-matched controls and circumcised men. All participants answered questionnaires and a subgroup was examined during an outpatient visit. Relationships with outcome were analysed using analysis of variance and regression analysis. RESULTS: 167 patients (mean age: 34 years, 63% distal, 24% mid and 13% proximal hypospadias) and 169 controls (mean age: 33 years), answered the questionnaire and 46 patients and 49 controls came for physical examinations. Patients were significantly less satisfied with the penile cosmetic outcome regarding all parameters in the Penile Perception Score (PPS). There was a difference in penile length between the two groups, 9.7 cm and 11.6 cm, respectively (p < 0.001). More patients than controls reported voiding dysfunction symptoms (p = 0.003). Patients had a lower maximum urinary flow rate (ml/sec) (p=0.001) than controls. These differences were most prominent between patients with proximal hypospadias and controls. CONCLUSIONS: Men operated on for hypospadias were less satisfied with the cosmetic result than controls. Their penile length was shorter. They presented with more symptoms of voiding dysfunction and displayed a lower maximum urinary flow rate. Patients with proximal hypospadias were more affected than those with milder hypospadias. Our results indicate that hypospadias could be sub grouped and that the severe phenotypes should be followed more during childhood as well as later in adulthood."
148,"To Be or Want to Be: Disentangling the Role of Actual versus Ideal Self in Implicit Self-Esteem."
149,"A growing body of work suggests that both depressed and non-depressed individuals display implicit positivity towards the self. In the current study, we examined whether this positivity can be underpinned by two qualitatively distinct propositions related to actual ('I am good') or ideal ('I want to be good') self-esteem. Dysphoric and non-dysphoric participants completed a self-esteem Implicit Association Test (IAT) as well an Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure (IRAP) targeting their actual self-esteem and an IRAP targeting ideal self-esteem. Both groups demonstrated similar and positive IAT effects. A more complex picture emerged with regard to the IRAP effects. Whereas non-dysphorics did not differ in their actual and ideal self-esteem, their dysphoric counterparts demonstrated lower actual than ideal self-esteem. Our results suggest that closer attention to the role of propositional processes in implicit measures may unlock novel insight into the relationship between implicit self-esteem and depression."
150,"Mitochondrial disturbances in HIV pregnancies."
151,"BACKGROUND:: Mitochondrial consequences from foetal exposure to HIV infection and antiretrovirals could be further investigated. OBJECTIVE:: The main objective of this study was to evaluate maternofoetal mitochondrial disturbances in HIV infection and antiretroviral administration in human pregnancies as the aetiopathogenic basis of suboptimal perinatal-clinical features. DESIGN:: Cross-sectional, prospective, observational, exploratory and controlled study. METHODS:: Clinical/epidemiological data of 35 HIV-infected pregnant women and 17 controls were collected. Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and RNA (mtRNA) content (RT-PCR), enzymatic activities and content (spectrophotometry) were measured in leucocytes. Genetic-functional, maternofoetal and molecular-clinical correlations were assessed. RESULTS:: Birth weight was lower in infants from HIV-infected mothers compared with controls. MtDNA values were slightly decreased in HIV cases, although not reaching statistical significance. MtRNA values were lower in HIV-infected mothers. Similarly, binary complex II+III enzymatic activity decreased to 50% in both HIV-infected mothers (44.45 +/- 3.77%) and their infants (48.79 +/- 3.41%) (P = 0.001 and P < 0.001). Global CI+III+IV enzymatic activity was lower in HIV-infected mothers and infants (90.43 +/- 2.39% and 51.16 +/- 9.30%) (P < 0.005 and P < 0.05). MtDNA content correlated with function in mothers and infants. Maternofoetal parameters correlated at genetic and functional levels. CONCLUSION:: HAART toxicity caused mitochondrial damage in HIV-infected pregnant women and their newborns, being present at a genetic and functional level with a maternofoetal correlation."
152,"Persistent HIV-related stigma in rural Uganda during a period of increasing HIV incidence despite treatment expansion."
153,"OBJECTIVE:: Programme implementers have argued that the increasing availability of antiretroviral therapy (ART) will reduce the stigma of HIV. We analyzed data from Uganda to assess how HIV-related stigma has changed during a period of ART expansion. DESIGN:: Serial cross-sectional surveys. METHODS:: We analyzed data from the Uganda AIDS Rural Treatment Outcomes study during 2007-2012 to estimate trends in internalized stigma among people living with HIV (PLHIV) at the time of treatment initiation. We analyzed data from the Uganda Demographic and Health Surveys from 2006 to 2011 to estimate trends in stigmatizing attitudes and anticipated stigma in the general population. We fitted regression models adjusted for sociodemographic characteristics, with year of data collection as the primary explanatory variable. RESULTS:: We estimated an upward trend in internalized stigma among PLHIV presenting for treatment initiation [adjusted b = 0.18; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.06-0.30]. In the general population, the odds of reporting anticipated stigma were greater in 2011 compared with 2006 [adjusted odds ratio (OR) = 1.80; 95% CI, 1.51-2.13], despite an apparent decline in stigmatizing attitudes (adjusted OR = 0.62; 95% CI, 0.52-0.74). CONCLUSION:: Internalized stigma has increased over time among PLHIV in the setting of worsening anticipated stigma in the general population. Further study is needed to better understand the reasons for increasing HIV-related stigma in Uganda and its impact on HIV prevention efforts."
154,"Detection of Colorectal Cancer (CRC) by Urinary Volatile Organic Compound Analysis."
155,"Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a leading cause of cancer related death in Europe and the USA. There is no universally accepted effective non-invasive screening test for CRC. Guaiac based faecal occult blood (gFOB) testing has largely been superseded by Faecal Immunochemical testing (FIT), but sensitivity still remains poor. The uptake of population based FOBt testing in the UK is also low at around 50%. The detection of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) signature(s) for many cancer subtypes is receiving increasing interest using a variety of gas phase analytical instruments. One such example is FAIMS (Field Asymmetric Ion Mobility Spectrometer). FAIMS is able to identify Inflammatory Bowel disease (IBD) patients by analysing shifts in VOCs patterns in both urine and faeces. This study extends this concept to determine whether CRC patients can be identified through non-invasive analysis of urine, using FAIMS. 133 patients were recruited; 83 CRC patients and 50 healthy controls. Urine was collected at the time of CRC diagnosis and headspace analysis undertaken using a FAIMS instrument (Owlstone, Lonestar, UK). Data was processed using Fisher Discriminant Analysis (FDA) after feature extraction from the raw data. FAIMS analyses demonstrated that the VOC profiles of CRC patients were tightly clustered and could be distinguished from healthy controls. Sensitivity and specificity for CRC detection with FAIMS were 88% and 60% respectively. This study suggests that VOC signatures emanating from urine can be detected in patients with CRC using ion mobility spectroscopy technology (FAIMS) with potential as a novel screening tool."
156,"Soyasaponins Prevent HO-Induced Inhibition of Gap Junctional Intercellular Communication by Scavenging Reactive Oxygen Species in Rat Liver Cells."
157,"It appears to be more practical and effective to prevent carcinogenesis by targeting the tumor promotion stage. Gap junctional intercellular communication (GJIC) is strongly involved in carcinogenesis, especially the tumor promotion stage. Considerable interest has been focused on the chemoprevention activities of soyasaponin (SS), which are major phytochemicals found in soybeans and soy products. However, less is known about the preventive effects of SS (especially SS with different chemical structures) against tumor promoter-induced inhibition of GJIC. We investigated the protective effects of SS-A1, SS-A2, and SS-I against hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)-induced GJIC inhibition and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in Buffalo rat liver (BRL) cells. The present results clearly show for the first time that SS-A1, SS-A2, and SS-I prevent the H2O2-induced GJIC inhibition by scavenging ROS in BRL cells in a dose-dependent manner at the concentration range of from 25 to 100 mug/mL. Soyasaponins attenuated the H2O2-induced ROS through potentiating the activities of superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase. This may be an important mechanism by which SS protects against tumor promotion. In addition, various chemical structures of SS appear to exhibit different protective abilities against GJIC inhibition. This may partly attribute to their differences in ROS-scavenging activities."
158,"Short-term Curcuminoid Supplementation for Chronic Pulmonary Complications due to Sulfur Mustard Intoxication: Positive Results of a Randomized Double-blind Placebo-controlled Trial."
159,"Pulmonary problems are among the most frequent chronic complications of sulfur mustard (SM) intoxication and are often accompanied by deregulated production of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Curcuminoids, comprising curcumin, demethoxycurcumin and bisdemethoxycurcumin, are phytochemicals with remarkable anti-inflammatory properties that are derived from dried rhizomes of the plant Curcuma longa L. (turmeric). The present pilot study aimed to investigate the clinical effects of supplementation with curcuminoids on markers of pulmonary function and systemic inflammation in SM-intoxicated subjects. In a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial, 89 male subjects who were suffering from chronic SM-induced pulmonary complications were recruited and assigned to either curcuminoids (500 mg TID per oral; n=45) or placebo (n=44) for a period of 4 weeks. Efficacy measures were changes in the spirometric parameters (FVC, FEV1, FEV1/FVC) and serum levels of inflammatory mediators including interleukins 6 (IL-6) and 8 (IL-8), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFalpha), transforming growth factor-beta (TGFbeta), high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), calcitonin gene related peptide (CGRP), substance P and monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1). 78 subjects completed the trial. Although FEV1 and FVC remained comparable between the groups, there was a greater effect of curcuminoids vs. placebo in improving FEV1/FVC (p=0.002). Curcuminoids were also significantly more efficacious compared to placebo in modulating all assessed inflammatory mediators: IL-6 (p<0.001), IL-8 (p=0.035), TNFalpha (p<0.001), TGFbeta (p<0.001), substance P (p=0.016), hs-CRP (p<0.001), CGRP (p<0.001) and MCP-1 (p<0.001). Curcuminoids were safe and well-tolerated throughout the trial. Short-term adjunctive therapy with curcuminoids can suppress systemic inflammation in patients suffering from SM-induced chronic pulmonary complications."
160,"Respiratory Syncytial Virus: Pathology, therapeutic drugs and prophylaxis."
161,"Human Respiratory Syncytial Virus (hRSV) is the leading cause of lower respiratory tract diseases, affecting particularly newborns and young children. This virus is able to modulate the immune response, generating a pro-inflammatory environment in the airways that causes obstruction and pulmonary alterations in the infected host. To date, no vaccines are available for human use and the first vaccine that reached clinical trials produced an enhanced hRSV-associated pathology 50 years ago, resulting in the death of two children. Currently, only two therapeutic approaches have been used to treat hRSV infection in high risk children: 1. Palivizumab, a humanized antibody against the F protein that reduces to half the number of hospitalized cases and 2. Ribavirin, which fails to have a significant therapeutic effect. A major caveat for these approaches is their high economical cost, which highlights the need of new and affordable therapeutic or prophylactic tools to treat or prevents hRSV infection. Accordingly, several efforts are in progress to understand the hRSV-associated pathology and to characterize the immune response elicited by this virus. Currently, preclinical and clinical trials are being conducted to evaluate safety and efficacy of several drugs and vaccines, which have shown promising results. In this article, we discuss the most important advances in the development of drugs and vaccines, which could eventually lead to better strategies to treat or prevent the detrimental inflammation triggered by hRSV infection."
162,"Regional fibrocartilage variations in human anterior cruciate ligament tibial insertion: a histological three-dimensional reconstruction."
163,"Abstract Purpose: We studied anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) tibial insertion architecture in humans and investigated regional differences that could suggest unequal force transmission from ligament to bone. Materials and Methods: ACL tibial insertions were processed histologically. With Photoshop software, digital images taken from the histological slides were collaged, contour lines were drawn, and different gray values were filled based on the structure. The data were exported to Amira software for three-dimensional reconstruction. Results: The uncalcified fibrocartilage (UF) layer was divided into 3 regions: lateral, medial and posterior according to the architecture. The UF zone was significantly thicker laterally than medially or posteriorly (P < 0.05). Similarly, the calcified fibrocartilage (CF) thickness was significantly greater in the lateral part of the enthesis compared to the medial and posterior parts (P < 0.05). Conclusions: The UF quantity (more UF laterally) corresponding to the CF quantity (more CF laterally) at the ACL tibial insertion provides further evidence suggesting that the load transferred from the ACL to the tibia was greater laterally than medially and posteriorly."
164,"Multiprofessional teamwork in work-related medical rehabilitation for patients with chronic musculoskeletal disorders."
165,"Objective: Systematic reviews indicate the effectiveness of multimodal rehabilitation. In Germany this has been shown, in particular, for work-related medical rehabilitation. A recently published guideline on work-related medical rehabilitation support the dissemination of these programmes. The feasibility of this guideline was examined in a multicentre study. This paper presents findings on the relevance of multiprofessional teamwork for the implementation of successful work-related medical rehabilitation. Methods: Focus groups were conducted with 7 inpatient orthopaedic rehabilitation teams and examined using qualitative content analysis. Results: Multiprofessional teamwork emerged inductively as a meaningful theme. All teams described multiprofessional teamwork as a work-related medical rehabilitation success factor, referring to its relevance for holistic treatment of multifactorially impaired patients. Although similar indicators of successful multiprofessional teamwork were named, the teams realized multiprofessional teamwork differently. We found 3 team types, corresponding to multidisciplinary, interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary team models. These types and models constitute a continuum of collaborative practice, which seems to be affected by context-related factors. Conclusion: The significance of multiprofessional teamwork for successful multimodal rehabilitation was underlined. Indicators of ideal multiprofessional teamwork and contextual facilitators were specified. The contingency approach to teamwork, as well as the assumption of multiprofessional teamwork as a continuum of collaborative practice, is supported. Stronger consideration of multiprofessional teamwork in the work-related medical rehabilitation guideline is indicated."
166,"High Uptake of Systematic HIV Counseling and Testing and TB Symptom Screening at a Primary Care Clinic in South Africa."
167,"BACKGROUND: Timely diagnosis and treatment of tuberculosis (TB) and HIV is important to reduce morbidity and mortality, and break the cycle of ongoing transmission. METHODS: We performed an implementation research study to develop a model for systematic TB symptom screening and HIV counseling and testing (HCT) for all adult clients at a primary care clinic and prospectively evaluate the 6-month coverage and yield, and 18-month sustainability at a primary care clinic in Johannesburg, South Africa. RESULTS: During the first 6 months, 26,515 visits occurred among 12,078 adults. The proportion of adults aware of their HIV status was 43.7% at the start of the first visit, increased to 84.6% at the end of the first visit, and to 90% at end of any visit during the first 6 months. During these 6 months, 1042 clients were newly diagnosed with HIV. HIV prevalence was 22.9% among those newly tested, and 58.9% among all adult clinic clients. High coverage of systematic HCT was sustained across all 18 months. Coverage of systematic HIV-stratified TB symptom screening during first 6-months was also high (89.6%) but only 35.0% of those symptomatic were screened by sputum. During these 6-months, 90 clients had a positive Xpert MTB/RIF assay, corresponding to a TB prevalence of 0.4% among all 23,534 clients TB symptom-screened and 2.8% among the 3,284 clients with a positive TB symptom screen. The initial high coverage of TB symptom screening was not sustained, with coverage of TB symptom screening dropping after the first six months to 70% and assessment by sputum dropping to 15%. CONCLUSION: Routine, systematic HCT and HIV-stratified TB symptom screening is feasible at primary care level. Systematic HCT doubled the proportion of clients with known HIV status. While HCT was sustainable, coverage of systematic TB screening dropped significantly after the first 6 months of implementation."
168,"Surface-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry using ordered silicon nanopillar arrays."
169,"Surface-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (SALDI-MS) is ideally suited for the high-throughput analysis of small molecules in bodily fluids (e.g. saliva, urine, and blood plasma). A key application for this technique is the testing of drug consumption in the context of workplace, roadside, athlete sports and anti-addictive drug compliance. Here, we show that vertically-aligned ordered silicon nanopillar (SiNP) arrays fabricated using nanosphere lithography followed by metal-assisted chemical etching (MACE) are suitable substrates for the SALDI-MS detection of methadone and small peptides. Porosity, length and diameter are fabrication parameters that we have explored here in order to optimize analytical performance. We demonstrate the quantitative analysis of methadone in MilliQ water down to 32 ng mL-1. Finally, the capability of SiNP arrays to facilitate the detection of methadone in clinical samples is also demonstrated."
170,"Lung tissue engineering and preservation of alveolar microstructure using a novel casting method."
171,"We used a rat model to decellularize and seed alveolar cells on a three-dimensional lung scaffold to preserve alveolar microarchitecture. We verified the preservation of terminal respiratory structure by casting and by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) of the casts after decellularization. Whole lungs were obtained from 12 healthy Sprague-Dawley rats, cannulated through the trachea under sterile conditions, and decellularized using a detergent-based method. Casting of both natural and decellularized lungs was performed to verify preservation of the inner microstructure of scaffolds for further cell seeding. Alveolar cell seeding was performed using green fluorescent protein (GFP) lung cells and non-GFP lung cells, and a peristaltic pump. We assessed cell seeding using histological and immunohistochemical staining, and enzymatic evaluation. All cellular components were removed completely from the scaffolds, and histological staining and SEM of casts were used to verify the preservation of tissue structure. Tensile tests verified conservation of biomechanical properties. The hydroxyproline content of decellularized lungs was similar to native lung. Histological and immunohistochemical evaluations showed effective cell seeding on decellularized matrices. Enzymatic measurement of trypsin and alpha 1 antitrypsin suggested the potential functional properties of the regenerated lungs. Casts produced by our method have satisfactory geometrical properties for further cell seeding of lung scaffolds. Preservation of micro-architecture and terminal alveoli that was confirmed by SEM of lung casts increases the probability of an effective cell seeding process."
172,"Baicalein inhibits agonist- and tumor cell-induced platelet aggregation while suppressing pulmonary tumor metastasis via cAMP-mediated VASP phosphorylation along with impaired MAPKs and PI3K-Akt activation."
173,"Recently, the importance of platelet activation in cancer metastasis has become generally accepted. As a results, the development of new platelet inhibitors with minimal adverse effects is now a promising area of targeted cancer therapy. Baicalein is a functional ingredient derived from the root of Scutellaria baicalensis Georgi, a plant used intraditional medicine. The pharmacological effects of this compound including anti-oxidative and anti-inflammatory activities have already been demonstrated. However, its effects on platelet activation are unknown. We therefore investigated the effects of baicalein on ligand-induced platelet aggregation and pulmonary cancer metastasis. In the present study, baicalein inhibited agonist-induced platelet aggregation, granule secretion markers (P-selectin expression and ATP release), [Ca2+]i mobilization, and integrin alphaIIbbeta3 expression. Additionally, baicalein attenuated ERK2, p38, and Akt activation, and enhanced VASP phosphorylation. Indeed, baicalein was shown to directly inhibit PI3K kinase activity. Moreover, baicalein attenuated the platelet aggregation induced by C6 rat glioma tumor cells in vitro and suppressed CT26 colon cancer metastasis in mice. These features indicate that baicalein is a potential therapeutic drug for the prevention of cancer metastasis."
174,"Effects of Perioperative Supplementation with Omega-3 Fatty Acids on Leukotriene B4 and Leukotriene B5 Production by Stimulated Neutrophils in Patients with Colorectal Cancer: A Randomized, Placebo-Controlled Intervention Trial."
175,"Omega-3 fatty acids (n-3 FA) may have beneficial clinical and immune-modulating effects in surgical patients. In a randomized, double-blind, prospective, placebo-controlled trial, 148 patients referred for elective colorectal cancer surgery received an n-3 FA-enriched oral nutritional supplement (ONS) providing 2.0 g of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and 1.0 g of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) per day or a standard ONS for seven days before surgery. On the day of operation, there was a significant increase in the production of leukotriene B5 (LTB5) (p < 0.01) and 5-hydroxyeicosapentaenoic acid (5-HEPE) (p < 0.01), a significant decrease in the production of leukotriene B4 (LTB4) (p < 0.01) and a trend for a decrease in the production of 5-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (5-HETE) (p < 0.1) from stimulated neutrophils in the active group compared with controls. There was no association between LTB4 values and postoperative complications. In conclusion, oral n-3 FA exerts anti-inflammatory effects in surgical patients, without reducing the risk of postoperative complications."
176,"Green Tea Consumption Affects Cognitive Dysfunction in the Elderly: A Pilot Study."
177,"Green tea is known to have various health benefits for humans. However, the effect of green tea consumption on cognitive dysfunction remains to be clinically verified. We conducted a clinical study to investigate the effects of green tea consumption on cognitive dysfunction. Twelve elderly nursing home residents with cognitive dysfunction (Mini-Mental State Examination Japanese version (MMSE-J) score: <28) participated in the study (2 men, 10 women; mean age, 88 years). The participants consumed green tea powder 2 g/day for 3 months. After three months of green tea consumption, the participants' MMSE-J scores were significantly improved (before, 15.3 +/- 7.7; after, 17.0 +/- 8.2; p = 0.03). This result suggests that green tea consumption may be effective in improving cognitive function or reducing the progression of cognitive dysfunction; however, long-term large-scale controlled studies are needed to further clarify the effect."
178,"Utility of cystatin C-derived equations for evaluation of residual renal function in peritoneal dialysis patients."
179,"Abstract Background: Residual renal function (RRF) plays a key role in the follow-up of the patients undergoing chronic ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD). Available methods for measurement of RRF are cumbersome and rarely used, and alternatively, cystatin C-derived equations have been proposed. Methods: Seventy-six adult CAPD patients were recruited. RRF was measured using the 24-hour urea-creatinine clearance method. Serum concentrations of cystatin C were determined. Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was estimated using the two published equations of Hoek and colleagues, and Yang and colleagues. GFR was also estimated from serum creatinine using the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI) formula. Results: Patients (age range 18-86 years) were on CAPD for a median of 24 months. Average serum concentrations of cystatin C was 5 +/- 1.2 mg/L. Average RRF was 0.7 +/- 1.6 mL/min/1.73 m2. All three methods significantly overestimated the measured RRF values (Hoek: 4 +/- 1.4; Yang: 4.5 +/- 1.5; 7.4 +/- 4 mL/min/1.73 m2). Based on Bland-Altman plots, all three methods yielded poor agreement with RRF (p < 0.001 for all tests), with Hoek's equation providing the narrowest limits of agreement [mean difference (limits of agreement): 3.4 (2.9-3.9)] and CKD-EPI the widest [6.7 (5.9-7.5)]. Although the Hoek's method outperformed CKD-EPI, the within 30 and 50% accuracy rates were unsatisfactory (10.5 and19.7 %, respectively). Conclusions: Cystatin C-derived equations outperform the CKD-EPI formula in approximating the RRF values. Yet, these methods still significantly overestimate the measured RRF and their routine application in clinical practice is not advised."
180,"The Effect and Mechanism of Growth Hormone Replacement on Cognitive Function in Rats with Traumatic Brain Injury."
181,"OBJECTIVE: The effects of growth hormone on cognitive dysfunction were observed in a controlled cortical impact (CCI) rat model and the underlying mechanism was explored. METHOD: Three-month-old male SD rats were randomly divided into sham (n = 10), control (n = 10), and CCI groups (n = 40) The parameters were set as follows: striking speed, 3.5 m/s; impact depth, 1.5 mm; and dwell time, 400 msec. Eight and ten weeks post-injury, the GH levels were measured the water maze test and novel object recognition test were performed. CCI rats were divided into normal and decreased GH groups, and further randomly divided into two sub-groups (rhGH treatment and saline vehicle groups). All rats were tested for SYN, BDNF, and TrkB mRNA in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus by RT-PCR. RESULTS: CCI rats 8 weeks post-injury had cognitive dysfunction regardless of the GH level (P<0.05). rhGH treatment improved cognitive function in CCI rats. There was a positive correlation between the expression of prefrontal BDNF and SYN mRNA in CCI rats after rhGH therapy and the water maze test score (r = 0.773 and 0.534, respectively; P<0.05). Furthermore, the expression of BDNF, TrkB, and SYN mRNA in the hippocampus was negatively correlated with the water maze test score (r = 0.602, 0.773, 0.672, and 0.783, respectively; P<0.05). There was a difference in the expression of hippocampal and prefrontal BDNF, TrkB, and SYN mRNA (P<0.05). CONCLUSION: rhGH treatment had a positive effect on cognitive function, which was more evident in GH-deficient rats. The increased expression of hippocampal and prefrontal BDNF and TrkB mRNA is implicated in rhGH therapy to improve cognitive function. Changes in the expression of hippocampal SYN mRNA following rhGH therapy may also play a role in improving cognitive function."
182,"Comparison of Combined and Sequential Surgery for Proliferative Diabetic Retinopathy: A Single Surgeon Study."
183,"PURPOSE: To compare the results of combined and consecutive surgeries to treat proliferative diabetic retinopathy and cataract. METHODS: Retrospective comparative study. Forty-one patients with proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR) were enrolled. Twenty-nine eyes for the combined surgery group and twelve eyes for the sequential group were included. All surgeries were performed by one surgeon. Phacoemulsification was performed using a clear cornea incision. The vitrectomy was performed using a 20-gauge vitreous cutter. RESULTS: The best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) and intra- and post-operative complications were the main outcome measures. In the combined surgery group, the BCVA increased in 18 (62.1%) eyes, while eight (27.6%) eyes remained stable and three (10.3%) eyes decreased. Postoperative complications included fibrinous exudation in nine eyes, macular edema in three eyes and vitreous hemorrhage in three eyes. In the sequential surgery group, the BCVA increased in seven (58.3%) eyes, remained the same in four (33.3%) eyes and was reduced in one (8.3%) eye. Postoperative complications included macular edema in two eyes, neovascular glaucoma in two eyes and vitreous hemorrhage in one eye. CONCLUSIONS: Both combined and sequential surgeries are safe and effective for treating PDR and cataracts. The combined surgery had a higher incidence of fibrinous exudation."
184,"Editorial: Oral Delivery of Biotechnology based Drugs: Dream or Reality?"
185,"Biotechnology has provided a wide array of therapeutic agents such as peptide, protein, vaccine and gene products that are currently mainly administered by means of injections. Therapeutic agents produced by biotechnological processes such as recombinant DNA technology, fermentation, tissue and cell culture technology as well as genetic engineering are usually large, hydrophilic molecules facing delivery challenges, for example, these drugs are susceptible to degradation and are generally poorly membrane permeable. Since successful delivery of any drug is a pre-requisite to achieve the therapeutic goal, novel strategies have emerged in the late 20th century to overcome challenges associated with the oral route of drug administration. These strategies include, but are not restricted to micro- and nanotechnology including self-emulsifying lipid based formulations, dendrimers and devices, permeability enhancing technology, targeting of active transporters and membrane receptors, use of cell penetrating peptides, chemical modifications of peptides such as inclusion complex formation and peptide conjugates, site-specific delivery systems, muco-adhesive systems and polymeric hydrogels. Despite the initial excitement regarding the potential of these technologies to provide effective oral delivery, few have advanced from the pre-clinical stage into clinical trials and very few, if any, resulted so far in registered medicinal products. Moreover, most literature provides information on effectiveness and mechanisms based on in vitro investigations without revealing the viability of these technologies in clinical practice. Although this topic of oral peptide delivery has gone through different phases in terms of attracting attention from the scientific community, it remains a timely research subject. The therapeutic benefits to patients and potential economic benefits to the producer serve as the driving forces behind finding an effective oral delivery system for biotechnology derived drugs. This special issue aims at assessing some of the latest developments in the field of oral delivery of biotechnological therapeutic agents. The reader will not only gain an understanding of the challenges associated with oral delivery of protein and peptide based drugs, but certain strategies that emerged to overcome these drawbacks are also discussed. From the discussions it is clear that scientific research has contributed to a deeper understanding of older drug delivery strategies, while new discoveries keep the vision of producing an effective oral peptide drug delivery system alive."
186,"Mycobacterium tuberculosis Requires the ECF Sigma Factor SigE to Arrest Phagosome Maturation."
187,"SigE represents one of the best characterized alternative sigma factors of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, playing a major role in the response to several environmental stresses and essential for growth in macrophages and virulence. In previous work we demonstrated that a mutant of M. tuberculosis in which the sigE gene was disrupted by a cassette conferring hygromycin resistance is a promising vaccine candidate conferring better protection than Mycobacterium bovis BCG in a mouse model of infection. In this work we describe the construction of a new unmarked mutant in which the entire sigE gene was disrupted in order to fulfill the requirements of the Geneva consensus to enter clinical trials. After showing that the phenotype of this mutant is superimposable to that of the previous one, we further characterized the role of SigE in the M tuberculosis intracellular behavior showing that it is dispensable for replication in human pneumocytes, while it is essential for the arrest of phagosome maturation in THP-1-derived macrophages."
188,"Symptomatic and asymptomatic secondary transmission of Cryptosporidium parvum following two related outbreaks in schoolchildren."
189,"SUMMARY Two related outbreaks (in 2009 and 2012) of cryptosporidiosis in Norwegian schoolchildren during a stay at a remote holiday farm provided us with a natural experiment to investigate possible secondary transmission of Cryptosporidium parvum IIa A19G1R1. After the children had returned home, clinical data and stool samples were obtained from their household contacts. Samples were investigated for the presence of Cryptosporidium oocysts by immunofluorescence antibody test. We found both asymptomatic and symptomatic infections, which are likely to have been secondary transmission. Laboratory-confirmed transmission rate was 17% [4/23, 95% confidence interval (CI) 7.0-37.1] in the 2009 outbreak, and 0% (95% CI 0-16.8) in the 2012 outbreak. Using a clinical definition, the probable secondary transmission rate in the 2012 outbreak was 8% (7/83, 95% CI 4.1-16.4). These findings highlight the importance of hygienic and public health measures during outbreaks or individual cases of cryptosporidiosis. We discuss our findings in light of previous studies reporting varying secondary transmission rates of Cryptosporidium spp."
190,"Developing a Follow-Up Strategy for Patients with PSA Ranging from 4 to 10 ng/ml via a New Model to Reduce Unnecessary Prostate Biopsies."
191,"OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to develop a follow-up strategy based on the new model to reduce unnecessary prostate biopsies in patients with prostate specific antigen (PSA) ranging from 4 to 10 ng/ml. METHODS: A total of 436 patients with PSA ranging from 4 to 10 ng/ml who had undergone transrectal ultrasound (TRUS)-guided prostate biopsy were evaluated during the first stage. Age, PSA, free PSA (fPSA), digital rectal examination (DRE) findings, ultrasonic hypoechoic mass, ultrasonic microcalcifications, prostate volume (PV) and PSA density (PSAD) were considered as predictive factors. A multiple logistic regression analysis involving a backward elimination selection procedure was applied to select independent predictors. After a comprehensive analysis of all results, we developed a new model to assess the risk of prostate cancer and an effective follow-up strategy. RESULTS: Age, PSA, PV, fPSA, rate of abnormal DRE findings and rate of hypoechoic masses detected by TRUS were included in our model. A significantly greater area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve was obtained in our model when compared with using PSA alone (0.782 vs. 0.566). Patients were grouped according to the value of prostate cancer risk (PCaR). In the second stage of our study, patients with PCaR>0.52 were recommended to undergo biopsies immediately while the rest of the patients continued close follow-up observation. Compared with the first stage, the detection rate of PCa in the second stage was significantly increased (33.0% vs 21.1%, p = 0.012). There was no significant difference between the two stages in distribution of the Gleason score (p = 0.808). CONCLUSIONS: We developed a follow-up strategy based on the new model, which reduced unnecessary prostate biopsies without delaying patients' diagnoses and treatments."
192,"Voluntary Exercise Prevents Cisplatin-Induced Muscle Wasting during Chemotherapy in Mice."
193,"Loss of muscle mass related to anti-cancer therapy is a major concern in cancer patients, being associated with important clinical endpoints including survival, treatment toxicity and patient-related outcomes. We investigated effects of voluntary exercise during cisplatin treatment on body weight, food intake as well as muscle mass, strength and signalling. Mice were treated weekly with 4 mg/kg cisplatin or saline for 6 weeks, and randomized to voluntary wheel running or not. Cisplatin treatment induced loss of body weight (29.8%, P<0.001), lean body mass (20.6%, P = 0.001), as well as anorexia, impaired muscle strength (22.5% decrease, P<0.001) and decreased glucose tolerance. In addition, cisplatin impaired Akt-signalling, induced genes related to protein degradation and inflammation, and reduced muscle glycogen content. Voluntary wheel running during treatment attenuated body weight loss by 50% (P<0.001), maintained lean body mass (P<0.001) and muscle strength (P<0.001), reversed anorexia and impairments in Akt and protein degradation signalling. Cisplatin-induced muscular inflammation was not prevented by voluntary wheel running, nor was glucose tolerance improved. Exercise training may preserve muscle mass in cancer patients receiving cisplatin treatment, potentially improving physical capacity, quality of life and overall survival."
194,"The Effects of Orally Administered Beta-Glucan on Innate Immune Responses in Humans, a Randomized Open-Label Intervention Pilot-Study."
195,"RATIONALE: To prevent or combat infection, increasing the effectiveness of the immune response is highly desirable, especially in case of compromised immune system function. However, immunostimulatory therapies are scarce, expensive, and often have unwanted side-effects. beta-glucans have been shown to exert immunostimulatory effects in vitro and in vivo in experimental animal models. Oral beta-glucan is inexpensive and well-tolerated, and therefore may represent a promising immunostimulatory compound for human use. METHODS: We performed a randomized open-label intervention pilot-study in 15 healthy male volunteers. Subjects were randomized to either the beta -glucan (n = 10) or the control group (n = 5). Subjects in the beta-glucan group ingested beta-glucan 1000 mg once daily for 7 days. Blood was sampled at various time-points to determine beta-glucan serum levels, perform ex vivo stimulation of leukocytes, and analyze microbicidal activity. RESULTS: beta-glucan was barely detectable in serum of volunteers at all time-points. Furthermore, neither cytokine production nor microbicidal activity of leukocytes were affected by orally administered beta-glucan. CONCLUSION: The present study does not support the use of oral beta-glucan to enhance innate immune responses in humans. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01727895."
196,"Combining MK626, a Novel DPP-4 Inhibitor, and Low-Dose Monoclonal CD3 Antibody for Stable Remission of New-Onset Diabetes in Mice."
197,"Combining immune intervention with therapies that directly influence the functional state of the beta-cells is an interesting strategy in type 1 diabetes cure. Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors elevate circulating levels of active incretins, which have been reported to enhance insulin secretion and synthesis, can support beta-cell survival and possibly stimulate beta-cell proliferation and neogenesis. In the current study, we demonstrate that the DPP-4 inhibitor MK626, which has appropriate pharmacokinetics in mice, preceded by a short-course of low-dose anti-CD3 generated durable diabetes remission in new-onset diabetic non-obese diabetic (NOD) mice. Induction of remission involved recovery of beta-cell secretory function with resolution of destructive insulitis and preservation of beta-cell volume/mass, along with repair of the islet angioarchitecture via SDF-1- and VEGF-dependent actions. Combination therapy temporarily reduced the CD4-to-CD8 distribution in spleen although not in pancreatic draining lymph nodes (PLN) and increased the proportion of effector/memory T cells as did anti-CD3 alone. In contrast, only combination therapy amplified Foxp3+ regulatory T cells in PLN and locally in pancreas. These findings open new opportunities for the treatment of new-onset type 1 diabetes by introducing DPP-4 inhibitors in human CD3-directed clinical trials."
198,"Effects of Intra-Aortic Balloon Counterpulsation Pump on Mortality of Acute Myocardial Infarction."
199,"BACKGROUND: Several randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have evaluated the effect of intra-aortic balloon counterpulsation pump(IABP) on the mortality of acute myocardial infarction (AMI). OBJECTIVES: To analyze the relevant RCT data on the effect of IABP on mortality and the occurrence of bleeding in AMI. DATA SOURCES: Published RCTs on the treatment of AMI by IABP were retrieved in searches of Medline, EMBASE, Cochrane and other related databases. The last search was conducted on July 20, 2014. STUDY ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: Randomized clinical trials comparing IABP to controls as treatment for AMI. PARTICIPANTS: Patients with AMI. SYNTHESIS METHODS: The primary endpoint was mortality, and the secondary endpoint was bleeding events. To account for to heterogeneity, a random-effects model was used to analyze the study data. RESULTS: Ten trials with a total population of 973 patients that were included in the analysis showed no significant difference in 2-month mortality between the IABP and the control groups. The 6-month mortality in the IABP group was not significantly lower than in the control group in the four RCTs that enrolled 59 AMI patients with CS. But in the four that enrolled AMI 66 patients without CS, the data showed opposite conclusion. CONCLUSIONS: IABP cannot reduce within 2 months and 6-12 months mortality of AMI patients with CS as well as within 2 months mortality of AMI patients without CS, but can reduce 6-12 months mortality of AMI patients without CS. In addition, IABP can increase the risk of bleeding."
200,"Implementation of Patient Safety and Patient-Centeredness Strategies in Iranian Hospitals."
201,"OBJECTIVE: To examine the extent of implementation for patient safety (PS) and patient-centeredness (PC) strategies and their association with hospital characteristics (type, ownership, teaching status, annual evaluation grade) in Iran. METHODS: A cross-sectional study through an adapted version of the MARQuIS questionnaire, eliciting information from hospital and nursing managers in 84 Iranian hospitals on the implementation of PS and PC strategies in 2009-2010. RESULTS: The majority of hospitals reported to have implemented 84% of the PS and 72% of the PC strategies. In general, implementation of PS strategies was unrelated to the type of hospital, with the exception of health promotion reports, which were more common in the Social Security Organization (SSO), and MRSA testing, which was reported more often in nonprofit hospitals. MRSA testing was also more common among teaching hospitals compared to non-teaching hospitals. The higher grade hospitals reported PS strategies significantly more frequently than lower grade hospitals. Overall, there was no significant difference in the reported implementation of PC strategies across general and specialized hospitals; except for the provision of information in different languages and recording of patient's diet which were reported significantly more often by general than specialized hospitals. Moreover, patient hotel services were more common in private compared to public hospitals. CONCLUSIONS: Despite substantial reporting of PS and PC strategies, there is still room for strengthening standard setting on safety, patient services and patient-centered information strategies in Iranian hospitals. To assure effective implementation of PS and PC strategies, enforcing standards, creating a PS and PC culture, increasing organizational responsiveness, and partnering with patients and their families need more attention."
202,"US Definitions, Current Use, and FDA Stance on Use of Platelet-Rich Plasma in Sports Medicine."
203,"With increased utilization of platelet-rich plasma (PRP), it is important for clinicians to understand the United States, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulatory role and stance on PRP. Blood products such as PRP fall under the prevue of FDA's Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER). CBER is responsible for regulating human cells, tissues, and cellular and tissue-based products. The regulatory process for these products is described in the FDA's 21 CFR 1271 of the Code of Regulations. Under these regulations, certain products including blood products such as PRP are exempt and therefore do not follow the FDA's traditional regulatory pathway that includes animal studies and clinical trials. The 510(k) application is the pathway used to bring PRP preparation systems to the market. The 510(k) application allows devices that are ""substantially equivalent"" to a currently marketed device to come to the market. There are numerous PRP preparation systems on the market today with FDA clearance; however, nearly all of these systems have 510(k) clearance for producing platelet-rich preparations intended to be used to mix with bone graft materials to enhance bone graft handling properties in orthopedic practices. The use of PRP outside this setting, for example, an office injection, would be considered ""off label."" Clinicians are free to use a product off-label as long as certain responsibilities are met. Per CBER, when the intent is the practice of medicine, clinicians ""have the responsibility to be well informed about the product, to base its use on firm scientific rationale and on sound medical evidence, and to maintain records of the product's use and effects."" Finally, despite PRP being exempted, the language in 21 CFR 1271 has caused some recent concern over activated PRP; however to date, the FDA has not attempted to regulate activated PRP. Clinicians using activated PRP should be mindful of these concerns and continued to stay informed."
204,"Clinical Effectiveness of Protein and Amino Acid Supplementation on Building Muscle Mass in Elderly People: A Meta-Analysis."
205,"OBJECTIVE: A major reason for the loss of mobility in elderly people is the gradual loss of lean body mass known as sarcopenia. Sarcopenia is associated with a lower quality of life and higher healthcare costs. The benefit of strategies that include nutritional intervention, timing of intervention, and physical exercise to improve muscle loss unclear as finding from studies investigating this issue have been inconsistent. We have performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the ability of protein or amino acid supplementation to augment lean body mass or strength of leg muscles in elderly patients. METHODS: Nine studies met the inclusion criteria of being a prospective comparative study or randomized controlled trial (RCT) that compared the efficacy of an amino acid or protein supplement intervention with that of a placebo in elderly people (>/=65 years) for the improvement of lean body mass (LBM), leg muscle strength or reduction associated with sarcopenia. RESULTS: The overall difference in mean change from baseline to the end of study in LBM between the treatment and placebo groups was 0.34 kg which was not significant (P = 0.386). The overall differences in mean change from baseline in double leg press and leg extension were 2.14 kg (P = 0.748) and 2.28 kg (P = 0.265), respectively, between the treatment group and the placebo group. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that amino acid/protein supplements did not increase lean body mass gain and muscle strength significantly more than placebo in a diverse elderly population."
206,"Increased orbitofrontal cortex activation associated with ""pro-obsessive"" antipsychotic treatment in patients with schizophrenia."
207,"BACKGROUND: Patients with schizophrenia have an approximately 10-fold higher risk for obsessive-compulsive symptoms (OCS) than the general population. A large subgroup seems to experience OCS as a consequence of second-generation antipsychotic agents (SGA), such as clozapine. So far little is known about underlying neural mechanisms. METHODS: To investigate the role of SGA treatment on neural processing related to OCS in patients with schizophrenia, we stratified patients according to their monotherapy into 2 groups (group I: clozapine or olanzapine; group II: amisulpride or aripiprazole). We used an fMRI approach, applying a go/no-go task assessing inhibitory control and an n-back task measuring working memory. RESULTS: We enrolled 21 patients in group I and 19 patients in group II. Groups did not differ regarding age, sex, education or severity of psychotic symptoms. Frequency and severity of OCS were significantly higher in group I and were associated with pronounced deficits in specific cognitive abilities. Whereas brain activation patterns did not differ during working memory, group I showed significantly increased activation in the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) during response inhibition. Alterations in OFC activation were associated with the severity of obsessions and mediated the association between SGA treatment and co-occurring OCS on a trend level. LIMITATIONS: The main limitation of this study is its cross-sectional design. CONCLUSION: To our knowledge, this is the first imaging study conducted to elucidate SGA effects on neural systems related to OCS. We propose that alterations in brain functioning reflect a pathogenic mechanism in the development of SGA-induced OCS in patients with schizophrenia. Longitudinal studies and randomized interventions are needed to prove the suggested causal interrelations."
208,"Salinity in Drinking Water and the Risk of (Pre)Eclampsia and Gestational Hypertension in Coastal Bangladesh: A Case-Control Study."
209,"BACKGROUND: Hypertensive disorders in pregnancy are among the leading causes of maternal and perinatal death in low-income countries, but the aetiology remains unclear. We investigated the relationship between salinity in drinking water and the risk of (pre)eclampsia and gestational hypertension in a coastal community. METHODS: A population-based case-control study was conducted in Dacope, Bangladesh among 202 pregnant women with (pre)eclampsia or gestational hypertension, enrolled from the community served by the Upazilla Health Complex, Dacope and 1,006 matched controls from the same area. Epidemiological and clinical data were obtained from all participants. Urinary sodium and sodium levels in drinking water were measured. Logistic regression was used to calculate odds ratios, and 95% confidence intervals. FINDINGS: Drinking water sources had exceptionally high sodium levels (mean 516.6 mg/L, S.D 524.2). Women consuming tube-well (groundwater) were at a higher disease risk than rainwater users (p<0.001). Adjusted risks for (pre)eclampsia and gestational hypertension considered together increased in a dose-response manner for increasing sodium concentrations (300.01-600 mg/L, 600.1-900 mg/L, >900.01 mg/L, compared to <300 mg/L) in drinking water (ORs 3.30 [95% CI 2.00-5.51], 4.40 [2.70-7.25] and 5.48 [3.30-9.11] (p-trend<0.001). Significant associations were seen for both (pre)eclampsia and gestational hypertension separately. INTERPRETATION: Salinity in drinking water is associated with increased risk of (pre)eclampsia and gestational hypertension in this population. Given that coastal populations in countries such as Bangladesh are confronted with high salinity exposure, which is predicted to further increase as a result of sea level rise and other environmental influences, it is imperative to develop and evaluate affordable approaches to providing water with low salt content."
210,"Chimaeric Virus-Like Particles Derived from Consensus Genome Sequences of Human Rotavirus Strains Co-Circulating in Africa."
211,"Rotavirus virus-like particles (RV-VLPs) are potential alternative non-live vaccine candidates due to their high immunogenicity. They mimic the natural conformation of native viral proteins but cannot replicate because they do not contain genomic material which makes them safe. To date, most RV-VLPs have been derived from cell culture adapted strains or common G1 and G3 rotaviruses that have been circulating in communities for some time. In this study, chimaeric RV-VLPs were generated from the consensus sequences of African rotaviruses (G2, G8, G9 or G12 strains associated with either P[4], P[6] or P[8] genotypes) characterised directly from human stool samples without prior adaptation of the wild type strains to cell culture. Codon-optimised sequences for insect cell expression of genome segments 2 (VP2), 4 (VP4), 6 (VP6) and 9 (VP7) were cloned into a modified pFASTBAC vector, which allowed simultaneous expression of up to four genes using the Bac-to-Bac Baculovirus Expression System (BEVS; Invitrogen). Several combinations of the genome segments originating from different field strains were cloned to produce double-layered RV-VLPs (dRV-VLP; VP2/6), triple-layered RV-VLPs (tRV-VLP; VP2/6/7 or VP2/6/7/4) and chimaeric tRV-VLPs. The RV-VLPs were produced by infecting Spodoptera frugiperda 9 and Trichoplusia ni cells with recombinant baculoviruses using multi-cistronic, dual co-infection and stepwise-infection expression strategies. The size and morphology of the RV-VLPs, as determined by transmission electron microscopy, revealed successful production of RV-VLPs. The novel approach of producing tRV-VLPs, by using the consensus insect cell codon-optimised nucleotide sequence derived from dsRNA extracted directly from clinical specimens, should speed-up vaccine research and development by by-passing the need to adapt rotaviruses to cell culture. Other problems associated with cell culture adaptation, such as possible changes in epitopes, can also be circumvented. Thus, it is now possible to generate tRV-VLPs for evaluation as non-live vaccine candidates for any human or animal field rotavirus strain."
212,"Infertility following retained products of conception: is it the surgical procedure or the presence of trophoblastic tissue?"
213,"OBJECTIVE: To compare the reproductive outcome of women who underwent re-evacuation of the uterine cavity due to suspected retained products of conception (RPOC) and in whom trophoblastic tissue was confirmed by histopathologic examination to those with negative pathologic findings. STUDY DESIGN: We retrospectively reviewed all cases of women who underwent uterine re-evacuation due to suspected RPOC between January 2000 and December 2010. Reproductive outcomes were compared between women in whom trophoblastic tissue was confirmed by histopathologic examination and those with negative pathologic findings. RESULTS: A total of 240 patients underwent uterine re-evacuation due to suspected RPOC, of whom 162 (67.5%) had pathological examination positive for RPOC, and 78 (32.5%) had pathologically negative RPOC. The rate of a new infertility problem following resection of a positive pathologic finding was significantly higher compared with a negative finding (P=0.029). The mean time to conception was significantly longer after resection of a positive pathologic finding compared with a negative finding (P<0.001). A significantly higher rate of hypomenorrhea/amenorrhea was found following resection of a positive pathologic finding compared with a negative finding (P=0.017). CONCLUSION: RPOC-associated infertility is primarily related to the presence of trophoblastic tissue rather than the surgical intervention per se in the gravid uterus."
214,"Effects of a contraceptive containing drospirenone and ethinylestradiol on blood pressure, metabolic profile and neurohumoral axis in hypertensive women at reproductive age."
215,"The use of combined oral contraceptives is widespread among hypertensive women despite being associated with increased cardiovascular risk. Contraceptives containing drospirenone, which has antimineralocorticoid properties, may have a positive or neutral effect on neurohumoral activation and metabolic homeostasis of hypertensive women at reproductive age. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effect of combined oral contraceptive containing drospirenone+ethinylestradiol on the systemic blood pressure, metabolic variables and neurohumoral axis in hypertensive women in reproductive age. DESIGN: Prospective controlled trial with 56 hypertensive women allocated in two groups: 30 volunteers under oral combined contraceptive use and 26 volunteers using non-hormonal contraceptive methods. Subjects were tested before the introduction of the contraceptive method and 6 months after its use. For data acquisition, we used continuous non-invasive beat-to-beat blood pressure curve recordings and, for the biochemical and hormonal analyses two blood samples were obtained. Student's t test was used to determine differences between groups and moments and p<0.05 was considered statistically signi fi cant. RESULTS: Comparing antropometric and blood pressure measurements, cardiac sympatho-vagal modulation, baroreceptor sensitivity, metabolic and neurohumoral axis variables between baseline and after 6 months, no signi fi cant difference was detected in each group or between groups. Except serum triglyceride levels which increased in the group of women using EE+DRSP after 6 months of use. CONCLUSION: A contraceptive containing 20mcg of ethinyl estradiol and 3mg of drospirenone causes no signi fi cant changes in clinical and autonomic parameters, metabolic variables and neurohumoral axis of hypertensive women."
216,"Pregnancy outcome of non-anonymous oocyte donation: a case-control study."
217,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the maternal and neonatal outcome of non-anonymous oocyte donation compared to in vitro fertilization. Study design We compared 84 oocyte donation pregnancies with a 251 matched in vitro fertilization cohort. Maternal and neonatal outcomes were retrieved from a nationwide perinatal registry. Oocyte donation and in vitro fertilization pregnancies were matched for maternal age, study center, ZIP code and embryo transfer date. Both maternal and neonatal complications and outcome were compared between oocyte donation and in vitro fertilization with univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses, adjusting for maternal age, donor age, socio-economic status, ethnicity, and parity. RESULTS: In total, 277 women underwent 541 oocyte donation cycles. The median recipient age was 34.9 years (IQR: 31.5-38.5), while the median donor age was 34.4 years (IQR: 31.7-37.0). Clinical pregnancy rate was 26.6%, which is comparable to standard in vitro fertilization treatment. Donor age in years (OR 0.93, 95% CI 0.88-0.99) and a previous pregnancy of the recipient (OR 1.69, 95% CI 1.02-2.78) were significantly associated with clinical pregnancy rate. Both singleton and multiple oocyte donation pregnancies were associated with pregnancy-induced hypertension compared with in vitro fertilization singleton and multiple pregnancies (OR 1.99, 95%CI 1.02-3.89, OR 6.43, 95% CI 1.67-24.72, respectively). No significant differences in neonatal outcome were observed. CONCLUSION: Oocyte donation pregnancies are associated with an increased incidence of pregnancy-induced hypertension compared with age-matched in vitro fertilization controls. However, no significant differences in neonatal outcome were observed between oocyte donation and in vitro fertilization."
218,"The Huntington's Disease-Related Cardiomyopathy Prevents a Hypertrophic Response in the R6/2 Mouse Model."
219,"Huntington's disease (HD) is neurodegenerative disorder for which the mutation results in an extra-long tract of glutamines that causes the huntingtin protein to aggregate. It is characterized by neurological symptoms and brain pathology that is associated with nuclear and cytoplasmic aggregates and with transcriptional deregulation. Despite the fact that HD has been recognized principally as a neurological disease, there are multiple epidemiological studies showing that HD patients exhibit a high rate of cardiovascular events leading to heart failure. To unravel the mechanistic basis of cardiac dysfunction in HD, we employed a wide range of molecular techniques using the well-established genetic R6/2 mouse model that develop a considerable degree of the cardiac atrophy at end stage disease. We found that chronic treatment with isoproterenol, a potent beta-adrenoreceptor agonist, did not change the overall gross morphology of the HD murine hearts. However, there was a partial response to the beta-adrenergenic stimulation by the further re-expression of foetal genes. In addition we have profiled the expression level of Hdacs in the R6/2 murine hearts and found that the isoproterenol stimulation of Hdac expression was partially blocked. For the first time we established the Hdac transcriptional profile under hypertrophic conditions and found 10 out of 18 Hdacs to be markedly deregulated. Therefore, we conclude that R6/2 murine hearts are not able to respond to the chronic isoproterenol treatment to the same degree as wild type hearts and some of the hypertrophic signals are likely attenuated in the symptomatic HD animals."
220,"Magnesium Protects Cognitive Functions and Synaptic Plasticity in Streptozotocin-Induced Sporadic Alzheimer's Model."
221,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by profound synapse loss and impairments of learning and memory. Magnesium affects many biochemical mechanisms that are vital for neuronal properties and synaptic plasticity. Recent studies have demonstrated that the serum and brain magnesium levels are decreased in AD patients; however, the exact role of magnesium in AD pathogenesis remains unclear. Here, we found that the intraperitoneal administration of magnesium sulfate increased the brain magnesium levels and protected learning and memory capacities in streptozotocin-induced sporadic AD model rats. We also found that magnesium sulfate reversed impairments in long-term potentiation (LTP), dendritic abnormalities, and the impaired recruitment of synaptic proteins. Magnesium sulfate treatment also decreased tau hyperphosphorylation by increasing the inhibitory phosphorylation of GSK-3beta at serine 9, thereby increasing the activity of Akt at Ser473 and PI3K at Tyr458/199, and improving insulin sensitivity. We conclude that magnesium treatment protects cognitive function and synaptic plasticity by inhibiting GSK-3beta in sporadic AD model rats, which suggests a potential role for magnesium in AD therapy."
222,"Antiinflammatory Effect of Phytosterols in Experimental Murine Colitis Model: Prevention, Induction, Remission Study."
223,"Phytosterols, besides hypocholesterolemic effect, present anti-inflammatory properties. Little information is available about their efficacy in Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD). Therefore, we have evaluated the effect of a mixture of phytosterols on prevention/induction/remission in a murine experimental model of colitis. Phytosterols were administered x os before, during and after colitis induction with Dextran Sodium Sulfate (DSS) in mice. Disease Activity Index (DAI), colon length, histopathology score, 18F-FDG microPET, oxidative stress in the intestinal tissue (ileum and colon) and gallbladder ileum and colon spontaneous and carbachol (CCh) induced motility, plasma lipids and plasma, liver and biliary bile acids (BA) were evaluated. A similar longitudinal study was performed in a DSS colitis control group. Mice treated with DSS developed severe colitis as shown by DAI, colon length, histopathology score, 18F-FDG microPET, oxidative stress. Both spontaneous and induced ileal and colonic motility were severely disturbed. The same was observed with gallbladder. DSS colitis resulted in an increase in plasma cholesterol, and a modification of the BA pattern. Phytosterols feeding did not prevent colitis onset but significantly reduced the severity of the disease and improved clinical and histological remission. It had strong antioxidant effects, almost restored colon, ileal and gallbladder motility. Plasmatic levels of cholesterol were also reduced. DSS induced a modification in the BA pattern consistent with an increase in the intestinal BA deconjugating bacteria, prevented by phytosterols. Phytosterols seem a potential nutraceutical tool for gastrointestinal inflammatory diseases, combining metabolic systematic and local anti-inflammatory effects."
224,"Efficacy Outcome Selection in the Therapeutic Hypothermia After Pediatric Cardiac Arrest Trials."
225,"OBJECTIVES:: The Therapeutic Hypothermia After Pediatric Cardiac Arrest trials will determine whether therapeutic hypothermia improves survival with good neurobehavioral outcome, as assessed by the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales Second Edition, in children resuscitated after cardiac arrest in the in-hospital and out-of-hospital settings. We describe the innovative efficacy outcome selection process during Therapeutic Hypothermia After Pediatric Cardiac Arrest protocol development. DESIGN/SETTING:: Consensus assessment of potential outcomes and evaluation timepoints. INTERVENTIONS:: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS:: We evaluated practical and technical advantages of several follow-up timepoints and continuous/categorical outcome variants. Simulations estimated power assuming varying hypothermia benefit on mortality and on neurobehavioral function among survivors. Twelve months after arrest was selected as the optimal assessment timepoint for pragmatic and clinical reasons. Change in Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales Second Edition from prearrest level, measured as quasicontinuous with death and vegetative status being worst-possible levels, yielded optimal statistical power. However, clinicians preferred simpler multicategorical or binary outcomes because of easier interpretability and favored outcomes based solely on postarrest status because of concerns about accurate parental assessment of prearrest status and differing clinical impact of a given Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales Second Edition change depending on prearrest status. Simulations found only modest power loss from categorizing or dichotomizing quasicontinuous outcomes because of high expected mortality. The primary outcome selected was survival with 12-month Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales Second Edition no less than two SD below a reference population mean (70 points), necessarily evaluated only among children with prearrest Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales Second Edition greater than or equal to 70. Two secondary efficacy outcomes, 12-month survival and quasicontinuous Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales Second Edition change from prearrest level, will be evaluated among all randomized children, including those with compromised function prearrest. CONCLUSIONS:: Extensive discussion of optimal efficacy assessment timing, and of the advantages versus drawbacks of incorporating prearrest status and using quasicontinuous versus simpler outcomes, was highly beneficial to the final Therapeutic Hypothermia After Pediatric Cardiac Arrest design. A relatively simple, binary primary outcome evaluated at 12 months was selected, with two secondary outcomes that address the potential disadvantages of primary outcome."
226,"Blood-brain barrier dysfunction in mice induced by lipopolysaccharide is attenuated by dapsone."
227,"Blood-brain barrier (BBB) dysfunction is a key event in the development of many central nervous system (CNS) diseases, such as septic encephalopathy and stroke. 4,4'-Diaminodiphenylsulfone (DDS, Dapsone) has displayed neuroprotective effect, but whether DDS has protective role on BBB integrity is not clear. This study was designed to examine the effect of DDS on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced BBB disruption and oxidative stress in brain vessels. Using in vivo multiphoton imaging, we found that DDS administration significantly restored BBB integrity compromised by LPS. DDS also increased the expression of tight junction proteins occludin, zona occludens-1 (ZO-1) and claudin-5 in brain vessels. Level of reactive oxygen species (ROS) was reduced by DDS treatment, which may due to decreased nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase activity and NOX2 expression. Our results showed that LPS-induced BBB dysfunction could be attenuated by DDS, indicated that DDS has a therapeutic potential for treating CNS infection and other BBB related diseases."
228,"Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4): localization and activity in human and rodent islets."
229,"Dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP-4) was recently found to be expressed in human and mouse islets with different expression pattern. However, whether species-dependent expression pattern is a generalized phenomenon and whether islet DPP-4 activity is regulated are not known. This study was conducted to investigate DPP-4 localization in several different species, and to examine the impact of glucose, incretin hormones, and insulin on islet DPP-4 activity. It was shown by immuofluorescent staining that there were two distinct species-specific expression pattern of islet DPP-4. The enzyme was expressed exclusively in alpha-cells in human and pig islets, but primarily in beta-cells in mouse and rat islets. INS-1 832/13 cells also expressed DPP-4, and inhibition of DPP-4 enhanced insulin secretion in the presence of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) in the cells. DPP-4 activity was remarkably robust when cultured with high glucose, incretin hormones, and insulin in mouse and human islets as well as INS-1 832/13 cells and islet DPP-4 activity and expression pattern was not altered in double incretin receptor knockout mice, compared to wild type mice. We conclude that islet DPP-4 is species-specifically expressed in alpha-cell and ss-cell dominant patterns in several species and both patterns remained robust in enzyme activity during short-term metabolic challenge."
230,"Negative Regulation of Grb10 Interacting GYF Protein 2 on Insulin-Like Growth Factor-1 Receptor Signaling Pathway Caused Diabetic Mice Cognitive Impairment."
231,"Heterozygous Gigyf2+/- mice exhibits histopathological evidence of neurodegeneration such as motor dysfunction. Several lines of evidence have demonstrated the important role of insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor (IGF1R) signaling pathway in the neuropathogenic process of cognitive impairment, while decreased Grb10-Interacting GYF Protein 2 (GIGYF2) expression can alter IGF1R trafficking and its downstream signaling pathways. Growth factor receptor-bound protein 10 (Grb10), a suppressor of IGF1R pathway, has been shown to play a critical role in regulating diabetes-associated cognitive impairment. It remains unknown whether endogenous GIGYF2 expression contributes to the development of diabetes-associated cognitive impairment. Using streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic mice model, we first demonstrated that a significantly increased level of GIGYF2 expression was correlated with a significant decrease in the expression of phosphorylated IGF1R as well as the phosphorylation of AKT and ERK1/2, two signaling pathways downstream of IGF1R, in the hippocampus of diabetic mice. On the contrary, in situ knockdown of GIGYF2 expression in hippocampus resulted in increased expression of phosphorylated IGF1R expression and correspondingly reversed the down-regulation of ERK1/2 phsophorylation but had no obvious effect on Grb10 expression. Functionally, knockdown of GIGYF2 expression markedly ameliorated diabetes-associated cognitive dysfunction as well as the ultrastructural pathology and abnormal neurobehavioral changes. These results suggest that increased expression of GIGYF2 might contribute to the development of diabetes-associated cognitive disorder via negatively regulating IGF1R signaling pathway. Therefore, down-regulation of GIGYF2 expression may provide a potential novel approach to treat diabetes-associated cognitive impairment caused by aberrant IGF1R signaling pathway."
232,"An examination of camptocormia assessment by dynamic quantification of sagittal posture."
233,"Objective: Camptocormia is a disabling pathology of the axial system that debilitates patients in their daily life. To date, there have been no studies evaluating the impact of camptocormia on walking performance. This study presents a new method for assessing sagittal posture under walking conditions in patients with camptocormia. Design: The severity of camptocormia was evaluated by measuring sagittal inclination, represented indirectly by the horizontal distance between the C7 and S1 markers (C7 sagittal arrow; C7-SAR). Sagittal inclination was measured under various behavioural conditions using clinical, radiological and kinematic approaches. Patients: Forty-three patients were included in the study (17 with Parkinson's disease and 26 with idiopathic camptocormia). Results: Under static conditions, C7-SAR could be assessed using different methods. During walking, there was a dramatic increase in C7-SAR values. Correlation analysis revealed a relationship between functional impairment and dynamic C7-SAR values, but not with radiological C7-SAR values. Patients with Parkinson's disease behaved differently from idiopathic patients, suggesting the involvement of different underlying physiopathological mechanisms. Conclusion: Monitoring sagittal inclination during walking is more accurate than radiological measurements to determinine the detrimental effects of camptocormia and its consequences for quality of life."
234,"The Prevalence and Factors for Cancer Screening Behavior among People with Severe Mental Illness in Hong Kong."
235,"OBJECTIVES: Screening is useful in reducing cancer incidence and mortality. People with severe mental illness (PSMI) are vulnerable to cancer as they are exposed to higher levels of cancer risks. Little is known about PSMI's cancer screening behavior and associated factors. The present study examined the utilization of breast, cervical, prostate, and colorectal cancer screening among PSMI in Hong Kong and to identify factors associated with their screening behaviors. METHOD: 591 PSMI from community mental health services completed a cross-sectional survey. RESULTS: The percentage of cancer screening behavior among those who met the criteria for particular screening recommendation was as follows: 20.8% for mammography; 36.5% for clinical breast examination (CBE); 40.5% for pap-smear test; 12.8% for prostate examination; and 21.6% for colorectal cancer screening. Results from logistic regression analyses showed that marital status was a significant factor for mammography, CBE, and pap-smear test; belief that cancer can be healed if found early was a significant factor for pap-smear test and colorectal screening; belief that one can have cancer without having symptoms was a significant factor for CBE and pap-smear test; belief that one will have a higher risk if a family member has had cancer was a significant factor for CBE; and self-efficacy was a significant factor for CBE and pap-smear test behavior. CONCLUSIONS: Cancer screening utilization among PSMI in Hong Kong is low. Beliefs about cancer and self-efficacy are associated with cancer screening behavior. Health care professionals should improve the knowledge and remove the misconceptions about cancer among PSMI; self-efficacy should also be promoted."
236,"Clinical and biological differences between cryoglobulinaemic and hypergammaglobulinaemic purpura in primary Sjogren's syndrome: results of a large multicentre study."
237,"Objectives: To determine the clinical and laboratory differences between cryoglobulinaemic and hypergammaglobulinaemic purpura in primary Sjogren's syndrome (pSS), in a large Italian multicentre cohort. Method: Patients were selected according to the following criteria: fulfilling the American-European classification criteria for pSS, serum cryoglobulin and gammaglobulin levels evaluated, and lack of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. Multinomial analyses were performed by distinguishing three groups of pSS: (i) purpura associated with cryoglobulinaemic vasculitis (CV), (ii) purpura associated with hypergammaglobulinaemic vasculitis (HGV), and (iii) pSS patients without purpura (pSS controls). Patients with purpura but without cryoglobulins or hypergammaglobulinaemia were excluded. Results: A total of 652 patients were enrolled in this study. Group 1/CV comprised 23/652 patients (3.53%), group 2/HGV 40/652 patients (6.13%), and group 3/pSS controls 589/652 (90.34%). The three groups were found to be significantly different from each other (post-estimation test: group 1/CV vs. group 3/pSS controls: p < 0.0001; group 1/CV vs. group 2/HGV: p = 0.0001; group 2/HGV vs. group 3/pSS controls: p = 0.0003), thus confirming the different phenotypes of purpura in pSS.Multivariate analyses revealed that peripheral neuropathy (p < 0.001), low C4 (p < 0.001), leucopaenia (p = 0.01), serum monoclonal component (p = 0.02), and the presence of anti-SSB/La antibodies (p = 0.02) characterized CV whereas rheumatoid factor (p = 0.001), leucopaenia (p = 0.01), serum monoclonal component (p = 0.01), and anti-SSA/Ro antibodies (p = 0.049) were significantly associated with HGV. Lymphoma was associated only with CV. Conclusions: HGV is a cutaneous vasculitis, related to a benign B-cell proliferation, whereas CV is a systemic immune complex-mediated vasculitis with complement activation and a higher risk of lymphoma, thus confirming CV but not HGV as a prelymphomatous condition in pSS."
238,"Incidence of Incisional Hernia after Cesarean Delivery: A Register-Based Cohort Study."
239,"OBJECTIVE: To estimate the incidence of incisional hernias requiring surgical repair after cesarean delivery over a 10-year period. METHODS: This population- and register-based cohort study identified all women in Denmark with no history of previous abdominal surgery who had a cesarean delivery between 1991 and 2000. The cohort was followed from their first until 10 years after their last cesarean delivery within the inclusion period or until the first of the following events: hernia repair, death, emigration, abdominal surgery, or cesarean delivery after the inclusion period. For women who had a hernia repair, hospital records regarding the surgery and previous cesarean deliveries were tracked and manually analyzed to validate the relationship between hernia repair and cesarean delivery. Data were analyzed with a competing risk analysis that included each cesarean delivery. RESULTS: We identified 57,564 women who had had 68,271 cesarean deliveries during the inclusion period. During follow-up, 134 of these women had a hernia requiring repair. Of these 68 (51% [95% CI 42-60%]) were in a midline incision although the transverse incision was the primary approach at cesarean delivery during the inclusion period. The cumulated incidence of a hernia repair within 10 years after a cesarean delivery was 0.197% (95% CI 0.164-0.234%). The risk of a hernia repair was higher during the first 3 years after a cesarean delivery, with an incidence after 3 years of 0.157% (95% CI 0.127-0.187%). CONCLUSIONS: The overall risk of an incisional hernia requiring surgical repair within 10 years after a cesarean delivery was 2 per 1000 deliveries in a population in which the transverse incision was the primary approach at cesarean delivery."
240,"Oncogenic RAS-induced senescence in human primary thyrocytes: molecular effectors and inflammatory secretome involved."
241,"Oncogene-induced senescence (OIS) is a robust and sustained antiproliferative response to oncogenic stress and constitutes an efficient barrier to tumour progression. We have recently proposed that OIS may be involved in the pathogenesis of thyroid carcinoma by restraining tumour progression as well as the transition of well differentiated to more aggressive variants. Here, an OIS inducible model was established and used for dissecting the molecular mechanisms and players regulating senescence in human primary thyrocytes. We show that oncogenic RAS induces senescence in thyrocytes as judged by changes in cell morphology, activation of p16INK4a and p53/p21CIP1 tumour suppressor pathways, senescence-associated beta-galactosidase (SA-beta-Gal) activity, and induction of proinflammatory components including IL-8 and its receptor CXCR2. Using RNA interference (RNAi) we demonstrate that p16INK4a is necessary for the onset of senescence in primary thyrocytes as its depletion rescues RAS-induced senescence. Furthermore, we found that IL-8/CXCR2 network reinforces the growth arrest triggered by oncogenic RAS, as its abrogation is enough to resume proliferation. Importantly, we observed that CXCR2 expression coexists with OIS markers in thyroid tumour samples, suggesting that CXCR2 contributes to senescence, thus limiting thyroid tumour progression."
242,"Therapeutic effect of a TM4SF5-specific monoclonal antibody against colon cancer in a mouse model."
243,"Transmembrane 4 superfamily member 5 protein (TM4SF5) is presumed to serve as a molecular target to prevent or treat hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and colon cancer in a mouse model. Previously, we reported the efficacy of anti-cancer peptide vaccine targeting TM4SF5. In addition, we reported an anti-proliferative effect of anti-TM4SF5 monoclonal antibody in HCC. Here, we investigated expression of TM4SF5 in 45 primary colon cancer tissues. Almost all of the colon cancer tissues expressed TM4SF5 based on immunohistochemistry using anti-TM4SF5 monoclonal antibody. The treatment of human colon cancer cells with anti-TM4SF5 antibody reduced growth of TM4SF5 expressing cells and enhanced expression of E-cadherin and beta-catenin. Using mouse colon cancer models, we then evaluated the in vivo anti-cancer effect of anti-TM4SF5 antibody. Injection of the antibody significantly reduced growth of tumors priorly established by subcutaneous injection of human colon cancer cells HT-29 in a xenograft setting. We obtained similar results with mouse colon cancer cell line CT-26 in an allograft setting. Therefore, we suggest that the TM4SF5-specific monoclonal antibody has a therapeutic effect against colon cancer."
244,"Picropodophyllin causes mitotic arrest and catastrophe by depolymerizing microtubules via Insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor-independent mechanism."
245,"Picropodophyllin (PPP) is an anticancer drug undergoing clinical development in NSCLC. PPP has been shown to suppress IGF-1R signaling and to induce a G2/M cell cycle phase arrest but the exact mechanisms remain to be elucidated. The present study identified an IGF-1-independent mechanism of PPP leading to pro-metaphase arrest. The mitotic block was induced in human cancer cell lines and in an A549 xenograft mouse but did not occur in normal hepatocytes/mouse tissues. Cell cycle arrest by PPP occurred in vitro and in vivo accompanied by prominent CDK1 activation, and was IGF-1R-independent since it occurred also in IGF-1R-depleted and null cells. The tumor cells were not arrested in G2/M but in mitosis. Centrosome separation was prevented during mitotic entry, resulting in a monopolar mitotic spindle with subsequent prometaphase-arrest, independent of Plk1/Aurora A or Eg5, and leading to cell features of mitotic catastrophe. PPP also increased soluble tubulin and decreased spindle-associated tubulin within minutes, indicating that it interfered with microtubule dynamics. These results provide a novel IGF-1R-independent mechanism of antitumor effects of PPP."
246,"PssP2 Is a Polysaccharide Co-Polymerase Involved in Exopolysaccharide Chain-Length Determination in Rhizobium leguminosarum."
247,"Production of extracellular polysaccharides is a complex process engaging proteins localized in different subcellular compartments, yet communicating with each other or even directly interacting in multicomponent complexes. Proteins involved in polymerization and transport of exopolysaccharide (EPS) in Rhizobium leguminosarum are encoded within the chromosomal Pss-I cluster. However, genes implicated in polysaccharide synthesis are common in rhizobia, with several homologues of pss genes identified in other regions of the R. leguminosarum genome. One such region is chromosomally located Pss-II encoding proteins homologous to known components of the Wzx/Wzy-dependent polysaccharide synthesis and transport systems. The pssP2 gene encodes a protein similar to polysaccharide co-polymerases involved in determination of the length of polysaccharide chains in capsule and O-antigen biosynthesis. In this work, a mutant with a disrupted pssP2 gene was constructed and its capabilities to produce EPS and enter into a symbiotic relationship with clover were studied. The pssP2 mutant, while not altered in lipopolysaccharide (LPS), displayed changes in molecular mass distribution profile of EPS. Lack of the full-length PssP2 protein resulted in a reduction of high molecular weight EPS, yet polymerized to a longer length than in the RtTA1 wild type. The mutant strain was also more efficient in symbiotic performance. The functional interrelation between PssP2 and proteins encoded within the Pss-I region was further supported by data from bacterial two-hybrid assays providing evidence for PssP2 interactions with PssT polymerase, as well as glycosyltransferase PssC. A possible role for PssP2 in a complex involved in EPS chain-length determination is discussed."
248,"Expression of XPG Protein in the Development, Progression and Prognosis of Gastric Cancer."
249,"BACKGROUND: Xeroderma pigmentosum group G (XPG) plays a critical role in preventing cells from oxidative DNA damage. This study aimed to investigate XPG protein expression in different gastric tissues and in patients with diverse prognoses, thus providing insights into its role in the development, progression and prognosis of gastric cancer (GC). METHODS: A total of 176 GC, 131 adjacent non-tumour tissues, 53 atrophic gastritis (AG) and 49 superficial gastritis (SG) samples were included. Immunohistochemical staining was used to detect XPG protein expression. RESULTS: XPG expression was significantly higher in GC tissues compared with adjacent non-tumour tissues. In the progressive disease sequence SG-->AG-->GC, XPG expression was significantly higher in AG and GC compared with SG. Analysis of clinicopathological parameters and survival in GC patients demonstrated a significant association between XPG expression level and depth of tumour invasion, macroscopic type, Lauren's classification, smoking, Helicobacter pylori infection and family history. Cox multivariate survival analysis indicated that patients with positive XPG expression had significantly longer overall survival (P = 0.020, HR = 0.394, 95%CI 0.179-0.866), especially in aged younger than 60 years (P = 0.027, HR = 0.361, 95%CI 0.147-0.888) and male patients (P = 0.002, HR = 0.209, 95%CI 0.077-0.571). CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated that XPG protein expression was related to the development, progression and prognosis of GC, and might thus serve as a potential biomarker for its diagnosis and prognosis."
250,"Host Genetic Background Influences the Response to the Opportunistic Pseudomonas aeruginosa Infection Altering Cell-Mediated Immunity and Bacterial Replication."
251,"Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a common cause of healthcare-associated infections including pneumonia, bloodstream, urinary tract, and surgical site infections. The clinical outcome of P. aeruginosa infections may be extremely variable among individuals at risk and patients affected by cystic fibrosis. However, risk factors for P. aeruginosa infection remain largely unknown. To identify and track the host factors influencing P. aeruginosa lung infections, inbred immunocompetent mouse strains were screened in a pneumonia model system. A/J, BALB/cJ, BALB/cAnNCrl, BALB/cByJ, C3H/HeOuJ, C57BL/6J, C57BL/6NCrl, DBA/2J, and 129S2/SvPasCRL mice were infected with P. aeruginosa clinical strain and monitored for body weight and mortality up to seven days. The most deviant survival phenotypes were observed for A/J, 129S2/SvPasCRL and DBA/2J showing high susceptibility while BALB/cAnNCrl and C3H/HeOuJ showing more resistance to P. aeruginosa infection. Next, one of the most susceptible and resistant mouse strains were characterized for their deviant clinical and immunological phenotype by scoring bacterial count, cell-mediated immunity, cytokines and chemokines profile and lung pathology in an early time course. Susceptible A/J mice showed significantly higher bacterial burden, higher cytokines and chemokines levels but lower leukocyte recruitment, particularly neutrophils, when compared to C3H/HeOuJ resistant mice. Pathologic scores showed lower inflammatory severity, reduced intraluminal and interstitial inflammation extent, bronchial and parenchymal involvement and diminished alveolar damage in the lungs of A/J when compared to C3H/HeOuJ. Our findings indicate that during an early phase of infection a prompt inflammatory response in the airways set the conditions for a non-permissive environment to P. aeruginosa replication and lock the spread to other organs. Host gene(s) may have a role in the reduction of cell-mediated immunity playing a critical role in the control of P. aeruginosa infection. These results now provide a basis for mapping genomic regions underlying host susceptibility to P. aeruginosa infection."
252,"5-Alpha-reductase inhibitors in diseases of the prostate."
253,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To summarize the history of the use of 5-alpha-reductase inhibitors in the treatment of urologic diseases and discuss the current practices and indications for therapy. RECENT FINDINGS: 5-Alpha-reductase inhibitors (5-ARIs) are indicated in the treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) with obstructive urinary symptoms to reduce symptoms, reduce the risk of acute urinary retention, and reduce the risk of needing surgical management for this condition. These drugs have also been employed in the treatment of recurrent and refractory hematuria of prostatic origin because of their effect on the androgen-mediated angiogenic pathways in the prostate. Data support the use of 5-ARIs for this indication, though this is off-label use. There is no role for the use of 5-ARIs in primary prostate cancer chemoprevention and they may increase the risk of developing high-grade prostate cancer. Current investigations are underway to determine the efficacy of 5-ARIs in the secondary treatment of localized prostate cancer as adjunctive therapy, which may decrease the likelihood of prostate cancer progression and increase the likelihood that patients will remain on active surveillance. SUMMARY: 5-ARIs have significantly impacted the medical treatment of urologic disease, in particular BPH, and prostatic hematuria. Their use in the secondary treatment of prostate cancer is currently under investigation."
254,"Comparison of Shockwave Lithotripsy and Flexible Ureteroscopy for the Treatment of Kidney Stones in Patients with Solitary Kidney."
255,"INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVES: To compare the outcomes of these minimally invasive procedures in this patient population. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The database of our institution has been retrospectively reviewed and medical records of urolithiasis patients with a solitary kidney who underwent F-URS or SWL between January 2009 and December 2012 were examined. Retreatment rates, complications, changes in estimated glomerular filtration rates (eGFR) and chronic kidney disease (CKD) stages, and stone-free rates were compared between the two groups. RESULTS: Stones of 48 patients (mean age: 48.8+/-15.4, range: 14-76) with solitary kidneys were treated with SWL (n=30, 62.5%) or F-URS (n=18, 37.5%). Patient demographics and stone related parameters were similar. The most common stone location was pelvis in the SWL group (36.6%) whereas it was pelvis and a calyx in the F-URS group (38.8%). Complications and success rates were similar in both groups, however patients in the SWL group needed more sessions to achieve stone clearance (2.2+/-0.89 vs. 1.06+/-0.24, p=0.0001). Preoperative and postoperative eGFR and CKD stage changes were also similar. CONCLUSION: Both SWL and F-URS are effective and safe techniques, which can be used for the treatment of stones in patients with solitary kidney. However, patients treated with SWL need more sessions to achieve stone clearance."
256,"Rhodiola Rosea for Mental and Physical Fatigue in Nursing Students: A Randomized Controlled Trial."
257,"BACKGROUND: Fatigue is one of many unintended consequences of shift work in the nursing profession. Natural health products (NHPs) for fatigue are becoming an increasingly popular topic of clinical study; one such NHP is Rhodiola rosea. A well-designed, rigorously conducted randomized controlled trial is required before therapeutic claims for this product can be made. OBJECTIVE: To compare the efficacy of R. rosea with placebo for reducing fatigue in nursing students on shift work. DESIGN: A parallel-group randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial of 18-55 year old students from the Faculty of Nursing from the University of Alberta, participating in clinical rotations between January 2011 and September 2011. INTERVENTIONS: Participants were randomized to take 364 mg of either R. rosea or identical placebo at the start of their wakeful period and up to one additional capsule within the following four hours on a daily basis over a 42-day period. OUTCOMES: The primary outcome was reduction in fatigue over the 42-day trial period measured using the Vitality-subscale of the RAND-36, cross-validated by the visual analogue scale for fatigue (VAS-F). Secondary outcomes included health-related quality of life, individualized outcomes assessment, and adverse events. RESULTS: A total of 48 participants were randomized to R. rosea (n = 24) or placebo (n = 24). The mean change in scores on the Vitality-subscale was significantly different between the study groups at day 42 in favor of placebo (-17.3 (95% CI -30.6, -3.9), p = 0.011), The mean change in scores on the VAS-F was also significantly difference between study groups at day 42 in favour of placebo (1.9 (95% CI 0.4, 3.5), p = 0.015). Total number of adverse events did not differ between R. rosea and placebo groups. CONCLUSION: This study indicates that among nursing students on shift work, a 42-day course of R. Rosea compared with placebo worsened fatigue; however, the results should be interpreted with caution. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Clinicaltrials.gov NCT01278992."
258,"Radiation Therapy Remains The Key Cost Driver Of Oncology Inpatient Treatment."
259,"Abstract Objective: Current radiation therapy capacities in Serbia and most of Eastern Europe are heavily lagging behind population needs. Primary study aim was assessment of direct costs of cancer medical care for patients suffering from cancer with assigned radiotherapy based treatment protocols. Identification of key cost drivers and trends during 2010-2013 comparing brachytherapy and teleradiotherapy was secondary objective of the study. Methods: Retrospective, bottom-up database analysis was conducted on electronic discharge invoices. Payer's perspective has been adopted and one year long time horizon. Total sample size was 2544 patients during four years long observation period (2010-2013). Sample consisted of all patients with confirmed malignancy disorder receiving inpatient radiation therapy in a large university hospital. Results: Diagnostics and treatment cost of cancer in the largest Western Balkans market of Serbia were heavily dominated by radiation therapy related direct medical costs. Total costs of care as well as mean cost per patient were steadily decreasing due to budget cuts caused by global recession. Paradox is that at the same time budget share of radiotherapy increased for almost 15% and in value based terms for euro 109 per patient (in total euro 109,330). Second ranked cost drivers were nursing care and imaging diagnostics. Costs of high-tech visualising examinations were heavily dominated by nuclear medicine tests. Conclusion: Budget impact of radiation oncology to the large tertiary care university clinics of the Balkans is likely to remain significant in future. Brachytherapy exhibited slow growth pattern while teleradiotherapy remained stable in terms of value based turnover of medical services. Upcoming heavy investment into national network of radiotherapy facilities will emphasize the unsatisfied needs. Huge contemporary budget share of radiotherapy coupled with rising cancer prevalence brings this issue into the hot spot of the ongoing cost containment efforts by local governments."
260,"Discovery of New Imidazole Derivatives Containing the 2,4-Dienone Motif with Broad-Spectrum Antifungal and Antibacterial Activity."
261,"A compound containing an imidazole moiety and a 2,4-dienone motif with significant activity toward several fungi was discovered in a screen for new antifungal compounds. Then, a total of 26 derivatives of this compound were designed, synthesized and evaluated through in vitro and in vivo antifungal activity assays. Several compounds exhibited improved antifungal activities compared to the lead compound. Of the derivatives, compounds 31 and 42 exhibited strong, broad-spectrum inhibitory effects toward Candida spp. In particular, the two derivatives exhibited potent antifungal activities toward the fluconazole-resistant isolate C. albicans 64110, with both having MIC values of 8 microg/mL. In addition, they had significant inhibitory effects toward two Gram-positive bacteria, Staphylococcus aureus UA1758 (compound 31: MIC = 8 microg/mL; compound 42: MIC = 4 microg/mL) and Staphylococcus epidermidis UF843 (compound 31: MIC = 8 microg/mL; compound 42: MIC = 8 microg/mL). The results of an animal experiment indicated that both compounds could improve the survival rate of model mice infected with ATCC 90028 (fluconazole-susceptible isolate). More importantly, the two compounds exhibited notable in vivo effects toward the fluconazole-resistant C. albicans isolate, which is promising with regard to the clinical problem posed by fluconazole-resistant Candida species."
262,"Anti-Fibrosis Effect of Scutellarin via Inhibition of Endothelial-Mesenchymal Transition on Isoprenaline-Induced Myocardial Fibrosis in Rats."
263,"Scutellarin (SCU) is the major active component of breviscapine and has been reported to be capable of decreasing myocardial fibrosis. The aim of the present study is to investigate whether SCU treatment attenuates isoprenaline-induced myocardial fibrosis and the mechanisms of its action. Rats were injected subcutaneously with isoprenaline (Iso) to induce myocardial fibrosis and rats in the SCU treatment groups were intraperitoneally infused with SCU (10 mg.kg-1.d-1 or 20 mg.kg-1.d-1, for 14 days). Post-treatment, cardiac functional measurements and the left and right ventricular weight indices (LVWI and RVWI, respectively) were analysed. Pathological alteration, expression of type I and III collagen, Von Willebrand factor, alpha-smooth muscle actin, cluster of differentiation-31 (CD31), and the Notch signalling proteins (Notch1, Jagged1 and Hes1) were examined. The administration of SCU resulted in a significant improvement in cardiac function and decrease in the cardiac weight indices; reduced fibrous tissue proliferation; reduced levels of type I and III collagen; increased microvascular density; and decreased expression of alpha-smooth muscle actin and increased expression of CD31, Notch1, Jagged1 and Hes1 in isoprenaline-induced myocardial fibrosis in rats. Our results suggest that SCU prevents isoprenaline-induced myocardial fibrosis via inhibition of cardiac endothelial-mesenchymal transition potentially, which may be associated with the Notch pathway."
264,"Cellular Transport Mechanisms of Cytotoxic Metallodrugs: An Overview beyond Cisplatin."
265,"The field of medicinal inorganic chemistry has grown consistently during the past 50 years; however, metal-containing coordination compounds represent only a minor proportion of drugs currently on the market, indicating that research in this area has not yet been thoroughly realized. Although platinum-based drugs as cancer chemotherapeutic agents have been widely studied, exact knowledge of the mechanisms governing their accumulation in cells is still lacking. However, evidence suggests active uptake and efflux mechanisms are involved; this may be involved also in other experimental metal coordination and organometallic compounds with promising antitumor activities in vitro and in vivo, such as ruthenium and gold compounds. Such knowledge would be necessary to elucidate the balance between activity and toxicity profiles of metal compounds. In this review, we present an overview of the information available on the cellular accumulation of Pt compounds from in vitro, in vivo and clinical studies, as well as a summary of reports on the possible accumulation mechanisms for different families of experimental anticancer metal complexes (e.g., Ru Au and Ir). Finally, we discuss the need for rationalization of the investigational approaches available to study metallodrug cellular transport."

The known compounds were identified by comparison of their spectroscopic and physical data with those reported in the literature."
268,"Significance of Pulmonary Arterial Pressure as a Prognostic Indicator in Lung-Dominant Connective Tissue Disease."
269,"BACKGROUND: Lung-dominant connective tissue disease (LD-CTD) is a new concept for classifying the subset of patients with interstitial pneumonia who have clinical features suggesting an associated CTD, but whose features fall short of a clear diagnosis of CTD under the current rheumatologic classification systems. The impact of mean pulmonary arterial pressure (MPAP) in LD-CTD has not been sufficiently elucidated. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the survival impact of MPAP measured during the initial evaluation in patients with LD-CTD. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed the initial evaluation data of 100 LD-CTD patients undergoing pulmonary function test, 6-min walk test (6MWT), and right heart catheterization (RHC). RESULTS: The mean MPAP was 16.2+/-4.4 mm Hg, and 18 patients had MPAP>/=20 mm Hg. A univariate Cox proportional hazard model showed that MPAP and several variables have a statistically significant impact on survival. With stepwise, multivariate Cox proportional analysis, MPAP (HR = 1.293; 95% CI 1.130-1.480; p<0.001) and mean forced vital capacity (FVC) % predicted (HR = 0.958; 95% CI 0.930-0.986; p = 0.004) were shown to be independent determinants of survival. CONCLUSIONS: Higher MPAP and lower %FVC at the initial evaluation were significant independent prognostic factors of LD-CTD. MPAP evaluation provides additional information of disease status and will help physicians to predict mortality in LD-CTD."
270,"Impact of alpha-Targeted Radiation Therapy on Gene Expression in a Pre-Clinical Model for Disseminated Peritoneal Disease when Combined with Paclitaxel."
271,"To better understand the molecular basis of the enhanced cell killing effected by the combined modality of paclitaxel and 212Pb-trastuzumab (Pac/212Pb-trastuzumab), gene expression in LS-174T i.p. xenografts was investigated 24 h after treatment. Employing a real time quantitative PCR array (qRT-PCR array), 84 DNA damage response genes were quantified. Differentially expressed genes following therapy with Pac/212Pb-trastuzumab included those involved in apoptosis (BRCA1, CIDEA, GADD45alpha, GADD45gamma, GML, IP6K3, PCBP4, PPP1R15A, RAD21, and p73), cell cycle (BRCA1, CHK1, CHK2, GADD45alpha, GML, GTSE1, NBN, PCBP4, PPP1R15A, RAD9A, and SESN1), and damaged DNA repair (ATRX, BTG2, EXO1, FEN1, IGHMBP2, OGG1, MSH2, MUTYH, NBN, PRKDC, RAD21, and p73). This report demonstrates that the increased stressful growth arrest conditions induced by the Pac/212Pb-trastuzumab treatment suppresses cell proliferation through the regulation of genes which are involved in apoptosis and damaged DNA repair including single and double strand DNA breaks. Furthermore, the study demonstrates that 212Pb-trastuzumab potentiation of cell killing efficacy results from the perturbation of genes related to the mitotic spindle checkpoint and BASC (BRCA1-associated genome surveillance complex), suggesting cross-talk between DNA damage repair and the spindle damage response."
272,"Th1 Stimulatory Proteins of Leishmania donovani: Comparative Cellular and Protective Responses of rTriose Phosphate Isomerase, rProtein Disulfide Isomerase and rElongation Factor-2 in Combination with rHSP70 against Visceral Leishmaniasis."
273,"In visceral leishmaniasis, the recovery from the disease is always associated with the generation of Th1-type of cellular responses. Based on this, we have previously identified several Th1-stimulatory proteins of Leishmania donovani -triose phosphate isomerase (TPI), protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) and elongation factor-2 (EL-2) etc. including heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) which induced Th1-type of cellular responses in both cured Leishmania patients/hamsters. Since, HSPs, being the logical targets for vaccines aimed at augmenting cellular immunity and can be early targets in the immune response against intracellular pathogens; they could be exploited as vaccine/adjuvant to induce long-term immunity more effectively. Therefore, in this study, we checked whether HSP70 can further enhance the immunogenicity and protective responses of the above said Th1-stimulatory proteins. Since, in most of the studies, immunogenicity of HSP70 of L. donovani was assessed in native condition, herein we generated recombinant HSP70 and tested its potential to stimulate immune responses in lymphocytes of cured Leishmania infected hamsters as well as in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of cured patients of VL either individually or in combination with above mentioned recombinant proteins. rLdHSP70 alone elicited strong cellular responses along with remarkable up-regulation of IFN-gamma and IL-12 cytokines and extremely lower level of IL-4 and IL-10. Among the various combinations, rLdHSP70 + rLdPDI emerged as superior one augmenting improved cellular responses followed by rLdHSP70 + rLdEL-2. These combinations were further evaluated for its protective potential wherein rLdHSP70 + rLdPDI again conferred utmost protection ( approximately 80%) followed by rLdHSP70 + rLdEL-2 ( approximately 75%) and generated a strong cellular immune response with significant increase in the levels of iNOS transcript as well as IFN-gamma and IL-12 cytokines which was further supported by the high level of IgG2 antibody in vaccinated animals. These observations indicated that vaccine(s) based on combination of HSP70 with Th1-stimulatory protein(s) may be a viable proposition against intracellular pathogens."
274,"CCR5 Gene Editing of Resting CD4 T Cells by Transient ZFN Expression From HIV Envelope Pseudotyped Nonintegrating Lentivirus Confers HIV-1 Resistance in Humanized Mice."
275,"CCR5 disruption by zinc finger nucleases (ZFNs) is a promising method for HIV-1 gene therapy. However, successful clinical translation of this strategy necessitates the development of a safe and effective method for delivery into relevant cells. We used non-integrating lentivirus (NILV) for transient expression of ZFNs and pseudotyped the virus with HIV-envelope for targeted delivery to CD4+ T cells. Both activated and resting primary CD4+ T cells transduced with CCR5-ZFNs NILV showed resistance to HIV-1 infection in vitro. Furthermore, NILV transduced resting CD4+ T cells from HIV-1 seronegative individuals were resistant to HIV-1 challenge when reconstituted into NOD-scid IL2rgammac null (NSG) mice. Likewise, endogenous virus replication was suppressed in NSG mice reconstituted with CCR5-ZFN-transduced resting CD4+ T cells from treatment naive as well as ART-treated HIV-1 seropositive patients. Taken together, NILV pseudotyped with HIV envelope provides a simple and clinically viable strategy for HIV-1 gene therapy."

This paradigm is illustrated through the interpretation of practical examples of behavior. Applications of current neuropsychological tests are presented within this interactive paradigm. The development of new neuropsychological tests is presented, as derived from experimental test paradigms that evaluate implicit learning processes."
278,"Large-Scale Brain Systems and Subcortical Relationships: The Vertically Organized Brain."
279,"This article reviews the vertical organization of the brain. The cortico-basal ganglia and the cerebro-cerebellar circuitry systems are described as fundamental to cognitive and behavioral control. The basal ganglia anticipate and guide implicitly learned behaviors on the basis of experienced reward outcomes. The cerebellar-cortical network anticipates sensorimotor outcomes, allowing behaviors to be adapted across changing settings and across contexts. These vertically organized systems, operating together, represent the underpinning of cognitive control. The medial temporal lobe system, and its development, is also reviewed in order to better understand how brain systems interact for both implicit and explicit cognitive control."
280,"The Small-World Organization of Large-Scale Brain Systems and Relationships With Subcortical Structures."
281,"Brain structure and function is characterized by large-scale brain systems. However, each system has its own ""small-world"" organization, with sub-regions, or ""hubs,"" that have varying degrees of specialization for certain cognitive and behavioral processes. This article describes this small-world organization, and the concepts of functional specialization and functional integration are defined and explained through practical examples. We also describe the development of large-scale brain systems and this small-world organization as a sensitive, protracted process, vulnerable to a variety of influences that generate neurodevelopmental disorders."
282,"Structure and Function of Large-Scale Brain Systems."
283,"This article introduces the functional neuroanatomy of large-scale brain systems. Both the structure and functions of these brain networks are presented. All human behavior is the result of interactions within and between these brain systems. This system of brain function completely changes our understanding of how cognition and behavior are organized within the brain, replacing the traditional lesion model. Understanding behavior within the context of brain network interactions has profound implications for modifying abstract constructs such as attention, learning, and memory. These constructs also must be understood within the framework of a paradigm shift, which emphasizes ongoing interactions within a dynamically changing environment."
284,"Atypical parietal lobe activity to subliminal faces in youth with a family history of alcoholism."
285,"Abstract Background: Adults with alcohol use disorders (AUDs) show different behavioral and neurological functioning during emotional processing tasks from healthy controls. Adults with a family history (FHP) of AUD also show different activation in limbic brain areas, such as the amygdala. However, it is unclear if this pattern exists during adolescence before any episodes of heavy alcohol use. Objectives: We hypothesized that the amygdalar response to subliminally-presented fearful faces would be reduced in FHP adolescents compared to peers who were family history negative (FHN) for AUD. Method: An adapted Masked Faces paradigm was used to examine blood oxygen level-dependent response to subliminal fearful vs. neutral faces in 14 FHP (6 females, 8 males) and 15 FHN (6 females, 9 males) youth, ages 11-15 years. Both FHP and FHN youth had no history of heavy alcohol consumption. Results: A significant difference was seen between groups in the left superior parietal lobule FHN youth showed deactivation to fearful and neutral masked faces compared to baseline, whereas FHP youth showed deactivation only to fearful masked faces. No significant differences in amygdalar activation were seen between groups. Conclusion: The left superior parietal lobule is part of the fronto-parietal network, which has been implicated in attentional control. Lack of reduced neural activity to neutral faces among FHP youth may represent differences in suppressing attention networks to less salient emotional stimuli, or perhaps, a higher threshold of saliency for emotional stimuli among at-risk youth."
286,"Editorial: Unlocking the Potential of Stem Cells in Cell Therapy, Drug Delivery and Drug Discovery."
287,"In metazoans, adult, tissue-specific stem cells function to naturally replace and regenerate components of organ systems during life. The restorative power of adult stem cells has been best exploited clinically in bone marrow transplantation to treat blood cancers and other disorders. With the discovery and characterisation of other adult stem cell types and pluripotent stem cells capable of generating all tissues in the body, it has been postulated that stem cells may be of utility in replacing other tissues which have stopped functioning due to age or disease. However, the potential application of stem cells to regenerative medicine is vast and more multi-faceted than simply furnishing replacement tissue in failing organ systems. In this minithematic issue of Current Drug Delivery, we explore these other applications focusing on current knowledge about the regulation of stem cells, its implications for pathogenesis in cancer and cell therapy and how stem cells may be used as drug delivery agents and as tools in disease modelling and drug discovery. Adult stem cell function during homeostasis and in response to periods of physiological demand relies on strict intrinsic regulation interwoven with complex extrinsic signals emanating from the micro-environment (or 'niche'). That proper adult stem cell function in vivo is dependent on its niche was the concept first invoked in the blood system in the 1970s and is an idea that has gained considerable traction in this and other tissue systems more recently. The overall complexity of adult stem cell niches is gradually being understood at the level of cellular constituents and molecular pathways controlling their behaviour. In addition to its purely supportive role as a habitat for the stem cell, it is responsible for secreting growth factors and other regulatory proteins that extrinsically regulate stem cell functionality. Crawford and colleagues review the role of pigment epitheliumderived factor (PEDF), a critical regulator of neural stem cell self-renewal in the neural stem cell niche. The authors explore the potential therapeutic role of PEDF where its opposing positive effect on stem cell behaviour and powerful anti-angiogenic effect on cancers make it possible for it to operate as a selective drug in cancer while sparing or possibly boosting normal tissue function through harnessing endogenous stem cell function. It has also become increasingly clear how crucial the stem cell-niche collaboration is to the maintenance of normal tissue function: in the blood system the potentially dire consequences of disturbing particular constituents of the niche are evident in decreased stem cell function and the emergence of pre-cancerous and cancerous conditions in mouse models and select clinical syndromes. The niche may also provide a sanctuary that protects already existent cancer from the effects of treatment (e.g. chemotherapy), and enables eventual disease relapse. Bartos and Dubielecka-Szczerba explore how one potential component of the niche - actin cytoskeleton- is impacted by the Bcr-abl oncogene in chronic myeloid leukaemia, leading to drug and therapy resistance. Pluripotent stem cells, derived from the embryo (embryonic stem cells) or by reprogramming somatic cells to an embryonic state (induced pluripotent stem cells), and adult stem cells may impact cellular therapy in two distinct ways. As alluded to, they may directly replace damaged tissues in organ transplantation related strategies (see review by Stewart for examples using pluripotent stem cell derived tissue). Less well established but becoming more appreciated is that stem cells can function and act as drug delivery modalities, facilitating tissue replacement without formally integrating or replacing tissue. A case in point is mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (MSCs), which as English and colleagues discuss, have potent immune modulatory function that could be deployed to facilitate acceptance of allogeneic organ transplantation or to ameliorate graft versus host disease, a potentially fatal side-effect of allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (for another example, see Falanga and colleagues review of the use of MSCs to treat chronic wounds). Shinya Yamanaka was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology and Medicine in 2012 for discovering induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), underscoring their potential to revolutionise therapies for a plethora of debilitating and fatal diseases via cell replacement therapy or drug discovery. For example, the capacity to make iPSCs from a somatic cell of a patient afflicted with a given disease offers an unprecedented opportunity to peer into the evolution of that disease by essentially rewinding its history in vitro and modelling the earliest pathological steps associated with it, with an ultimate view of identifying drug targets for treatment. Stewart reviews and explains progress made to date with disease specific iPSCs in this context set against a historical perspective of the pluripotent stem cell biology field. Finally, translating the potential of pluripotent stem cell derived tissue or adult stem cells (e.g. MSCs) into both safe and effective clinical therapies in any setting involving administration of cellular products requires adherence to Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) supervised by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulatory framework in the United States and by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) in Europe. Falanga and colleagues outline the laborious yet essential strategy required to establish a GMP lab for these purposes and describe their experience with using the laboratory to manipulate MSCs that will encourage chronic wound healing."
288,"Annexin A8 Is a Prognostic Marker and Potential Therapeutic Target for Pancreatic Cancer."
289,"OBJECTIVES: We investigated whether annexin A8 (A-A8), a Ca-binding protein overexpressed in pancreatic cancer, plays a role in cell growth and migration and investigated its association with pancreatic cancer prognosis. METHODS: Clinicopathological features and associations between increased A-A8 expression (determined by immunohistochemistry) and histologic grade were studied in a tissue microarray of 90 patients with resected stage I/II pancreatic cancer. We investigated A-A8's effect on cell migration, proliferation, and colony formation in 2 pancreatic cancer cells (BXPC-3 and Panc-1). Statistical analyses included Fisher exact test, t test, analysis of variance, and survival analysis. RESULTS: Western blot showed increased A-A8 expression in human pancreatic cancer cells, with A-A8 knockdown in BXPC-3 and Panc-1 cells demonstrating decreased cell viability (P = 0.017 and P = 0.001), migration (2.5 vs 0.9 mm and 1.6 vs 1 mm at 96 hours; P = 0.048 and P = 0.004), and colony formation (approximately 75% and 40% from scramble; P </= 0.01), respectively. In our tissue microarray, A-A8 expression increased 5.9-fold (r = 0.31; P = 0.019) from low- to high-grade tumors, correlating with tumor grade (r = 0.23; P = 0.027). In addition, high A-A8 expression was associated with a decreased 5-year survival (P = 0.042). CONCLUSIONS: Our study is the first showing that increased A-A8 expression is associated with poor prognosis in early-stage pancreatic cancer, thus supporting its further investigation as a future therapeutic target and prognostic marker."

295,"Unmet therapeutic needs in Behcet's disease have drawn recent attention to biological agents targeting cytokines other than TNF. The anti-IL-17 antibody secukinumab and the anti-IL-2 receptor antibody daclizumab were not superior to placebo for ocular Behcet's in randomised controlled trials, comprising 118 and 17 patients, respectively. The anti-IL-1 agents anakinra and canakinumab and the anti-IL-6 agent tocilizumab were given to isolated refractory disease patients, who were either anti-TNF naive (n=9) or experienced (n=18). No new safety signals were reported. Although a potential for bias to report positive effects and underreport negative cases may exist, Anakinra was partially effective, whereas disease remission was noted after canakinumab in some anti-TNF resistant patients. Tocilizumab appeared effective for neuro-Behcet's, but not for mucocutaneous manifestations. Finally, in a pilot study of 7 patients with relapsing posterior uveitis refractory to azathioprine and/or cyclosporine, the anti-IL-1beta antibody Gevokizumab was beneficial. Collectively, it seems that IL-1 and IL-6 are promising targets in patients refractory or intolerant to other regimens including anti-TNFs. However, controlled studies are surely needed."
296,"Gastrointestinal manifestations of Behcet's disease: advances in evaluation and management."
297,"Behcet's disease is a chronic, recurrent, inflammatory disorder characterized by orogenital ulcers and skin lesions; serious manifestations also include ocular, large vessel, gastrointestinal and neurological involvement. Genetic and unknown environmental factors customise the wide clinical expression of the disease. Gastrointestinal involvement is not unusual, albeit with a highly variable frequency among different ethnic populations. However, given the fact that gastrointestinal symptoms such as reflux, bleeding, diarrhoea are common in the general population, their clinical significance needs to be carefully interpreted. Apart from mouth the ileocecal area is typically involved, but inflammatory and/or vasculitic lesions may affect any part of the gastrointestinal tract. Complications such as perforation carry high morbidity rates and even mortality. Herein, we review all available information pertinent to gastrointestinal involvement of Behcet's disease and discuss the published advances in evaluation and its empirical management, including anti-TNF biologic therapies."
298,"Behcet's syndrome: a critical digest of the 2013-2014 literature."
299,"This review focuses on the recent research on the epidemiology, outcome measures, immunopathogenesis, genetics, clinical manifestations and management of Behcet's syndrome (BS). A systematic review of outcomes and outcome measures used in BS points out to a need for reliable and validated outcome measures that would be widely used by researchers. Despite novel methods of analyses and cheaper and more sophisticated technologies are yielding new genetic associations and molecular pathways in BS, HLA-B51 still shows the strongest link. The MHC class I amino acid residues, GIMAP, the neuromodulin pathway, complement component copy variations, microRNA polymorphisms and DNA methylation abnormalities are examples. IL-27, 33 and 37 may also play important roles in the pathogenesis. Clinical studies have shown that the fluorescein angiography scoring system could be a useful tool to discern active inflammation in eye disease from the quiescent phase, the cumulative risk for recurrence of any vascular event was 38% at 5 years in a large vascular cohort and significant correlations between dural sinus thrombosis and pulmonary artery involvement, a retrospective survey of patients with parenchymal NBS revealed a 30% relapse rate and 10% mortality of 10% after a median follow-up of 73 months, and quantitative measurement of the brainstem atrophy using MRI was correlated with clinical symptoms. Studies on the management of BS showed that continuous use of colchicine may not prevent the development of organ involvement at the long-term, remission of uveitis may persist after withdrawal of infliximab, refractory intestinal involvement may respond to infliximab, immunosuppressive treatment is important in reducing complications of endovascular stent grafting for aortic pseudoaneurysm and intravitreal steroid implants or injections may be considered in refractory uveitis."

Cardiac involvement like intracardiac thrombus and valvular involvement in BS are rarely seen entities. Here we present the management of a 23-year old male BS patient who had a right ventricular thrombus and tricuspid valve dysfunction which was resistant to immunosuppressive treatment. He has been doing well for 4 years after intraventricular thrombus resection and tricuspid valve replacement with bioprosthesis."
302,"Behcet's syndrome and pregnancy: course of the disease and pregnancy outcome."
303,"OBJECTIVES: To review the current available literature on the mutual effect of pregnancy or contraceptives and Behcet's disease (BD) in order to guide our patients more wisely before they take contraceptives or decide to conceive. METHODS: We performed a systematic review of the literature regarding the above issues using PubMed, Cochrane and EMBase databases. RESULTS: We have found 21 case reports and 11 series dealing with the mutual effect of pregnancy or contraceptives and Behcet's disease and 5 case reports dealing with BD and contraceptives. In most cases the course of BD was ameliorated or unchanged during pregnancy. The outcome of pregnancy in BD patients was poorer than that in healthy individuals. Contraceptives have various effects on the course of BD. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the above impression, it is quite difficult to predict the course of the disease during pregnancy in an individual BD patient. Patients with BD and a history of thrombosis are recommended to avoid contraceptive pills."

The aim of this study was to verify the usefulness of a simplified electronic medical record (EMR)-based activity index (EMRAI) for Behcet's disease. METHODS: A total of 73 Korean patients with Behcet's disease participated in this study. Two dermatologists interviewed each participant independently using two activity scoring systems: the EMRAI and the Behcet's Disease Current Activity Form (BDCAF). Overall agreement between raters, correlation between activity scoring indices, and total interview run-time were evaluated. RESULTS: The EMRAI significantly correlated with the BDCAF (Spearman's correlation coefficient, r=0.835), physician-assessed overall activity score (r=0.782), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (r=0.520) and C-reactive protein level (r=0.422). The weighted kappa score for inter-rater agreement of EMRAI showed very good reliability compared with that of BDCAF (0.894 and 0.693, respectively). The mean total run-time for the EMRAI was shorter than that required to administer the BDCAF (95 s and 115 s, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: The EMRAI, an EMR-based simplified activity index of Behcet's disease, facilitates rapid and simple gathering of disease activity data and clinical information."

311,"Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM)-induced cardiomyopathy is associated with cardiac oxidative stress, inflammation, and remodeling. Sulforaphane (SFN), an isothiocyanate naturally presenting in widely consumed vegetables, particularly broccoli, plays an important role in cardiac protection from diabetes. We investigated the effect of SFN on T2DM-induced cardiac lipid accumulation and subsequent cardiomyopathy. Male C57BL/6J mice were fed a high-fat diet for 3months to induce insulin resistance, followed by a treatment with 100mg/kg body-weight streptozotocin to induce hyperglycemia, as T2DM mouse model. Other age-matched mice were fed normal diet as control. T2DM and control mice were treated with or without 4-month SFN at 0.5mg/kg daily five days a week. At the study's end, cardiac function was assessed. SFN treatment significantly attenuated cardiac remodeling and dysfunction induced by T2DM. SFN treatment also significantly inhibited cardiac lipid accumulation, measured by Oil Red O staining, and improved cardiac inflammation oxidative stress and fibrosis, shown by down-regulating diabetes-induced PAI-1, TNF-alpha, CTGF, TGF-beta, 3-NT, and 4-HNE expression. Elevated 4-HNE resulted in the increase of 4-HNE-LKB1 adducts that should inhibit LKB1 and subsequent AMPK activity. SFN upregulated the expression of Nrf2 and its downstream genes, NQO1 and HO-1, decreased 4-HNE-LKB1 adducts and then reversed diabetes-induced inhibition of LKB1/AMPK and its downstream targets, including sirtuin 1, PGC-1alpha, phosphorylated acetyl-CoA carboxylase, carnitine palmitoyl transferase-1, ULK1, and light chain-3 II. These results suggest that SFN treatment to T2DM mice may attenuate the cardiac oxidative stress-induced inhibition of LKB1/AMPK signaling pathway, thereby preventing T2DM-induced lipotoxicity and cardiomyopathy."
312,"Inflammasome Activation Is Critical to the Protective Immune Response during Chemically Induced Squamous Cell Carcinoma."
313,"Chronic inflammation affects most stages of tumorigenesis, including initiation, promotion, malignant differentiation, invasion and metastasis. Inflammasomes have been described as involved with persistent inflammation and are known to exert both pro and antitumour effects. We evaluated the influence of apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a caspase recruitment domain (ASC) and caspase (CASP)-1 in the antitumor immune response using a multistage model of squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) development. Absence of ASC and CASP-1 resulted in an earlier incidence and increased number of papilloma. Loss of inflammassome function in mice resulted in decreased presence of natural killer (NK), dendritic (DC), CD4+, CD8+ and CD45RB+ T cells in the tumor lesions as well as in lymph nodes (LN) compared with WT mice. Increased percentage of CD4+CD25+Foxp3+ T cells was associated with association with inflammasome loss of function. Moreover, significant differences were also found with neutrophils and macrophage infiltrating the lesions. Myeloperoxidase (MPO), but not elastase (ELA), activity oscillated among the groups during the SCC development. Levels of proinflammatory cytokines IL-1beta, IL-18, Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF)-alpha and Interferon (IFN)-gamma were decreased in the tumor microenvironment in the absence of inflammasome proteins. These observations suggest a link between inflammasome function and SCC tumorigenesis, indicating an important role for inflammasome activation in the control of SCC development."
314,"Persistent At-Level Thermal Hyperalgesia and Tactile Allodynia Accompany Chronic Neuronal and Astrocyte Activation in Superficial Dorsal Horn following Mouse Cervical Contusion Spinal Cord Injury."
315,"In humans, sensory abnormalities, including neuropathic pain, often result from traumatic spinal cord injury (SCI). SCI can induce cellular changes in the CNS, termed central sensitization, that alter excitability of spinal cord neurons, including those in the dorsal horn involved in pain transmission. Persistently elevated levels of neuronal activity, glial activation, and glutamatergic transmission are thought to contribute to the hyperexcitability of these dorsal horn neurons, which can lead to maladaptive circuitry, aberrant pain processing and, ultimately, chronic neuropathic pain. Here we present a mouse model of SCI-induced neuropathic pain that exhibits a persistent pain phenotype accompanied by chronic neuronal hyperexcitability and glial activation in the spinal cord dorsal horn. We generated a unilateral cervical contusion injury at the C5 or C6 level of the adult mouse spinal cord. Following injury, an increase in the number of neurons expressing DeltaFosB (a marker of chronic neuronal activation), persistent astrocyte activation and proliferation (as measured by GFAP and Ki67 expression), and a decrease in the expression of the astrocyte glutamate transporter GLT1 are observed in the ipsilateral superficial dorsal horn of cervical spinal cord. These changes have previously been associated with neuronal hyperexcitability and may contribute to altered pain transmission and chronic neuropathic pain. In our model, they are accompanied by robust at-level hyperaglesia in the ipsilateral forepaw and allodynia in both forepaws that are evident within two weeks following injury and persist for at least six weeks. Furthermore, the pain phenotype occurs in the absence of alterations in forelimb grip strength, suggesting that it represents sensory and not motor abnormalities. Given the importance of transgenic mouse technology, this clinically-relevant model provides a resource that can be used to study the molecular mechanisms contributing to neuropathic pain following SCI and to identify potential therapeutic targets for the treatment of chronic pathological pain."
316,"Unbiased Identification of Patients with Disorders of Sex Development."
317,"Disorders of sex development (DSD) represent a collection of rare diseases that generate substantial controversy regarding best practices for diagnosis and treatment. A significant barrier preventing a better understanding of how patients with these conditions should be evaluated and treated, especially from a psychological standpoint, is the lack of systematic and standardized approaches to identify cases for study inclusion. Common approaches include ""hand-picked"" subjects already known to the practice, which could introduce bias. We implemented an informatics-based approach to identify patients with DSD from electronic health records (EHRs) at three large, academic children's hospitals. The informatics approach involved comprehensively searching EHRs at each hospital using a combination of structured billing codes as an initial filtering strategy followed by keywords applied to the free text clinical documentation. The informatics approach was implemented to replicate the functionality of an EHR search engine (EMERSE) available at one of the hospitals. At the two hospitals that did not have EMERSE, we compared case ascertainment using the informatics method to traditional approaches employed for identifying subjects. Potential cases identified using all approaches were manually reviewed by experts in DSD to verify eligibility criteria. At the two institutions where both the informatics and traditional approaches were applied, the informatics approach identified substantially higher numbers of potential study subjects. The traditional approaches yielded 14 and 28 patients with DSD, respectively; the informatics approach yielded 226 and 77 patients, respectively. The informatics approach missed only a few cases that the traditional approaches identified, largely because those cases were known to the study team, but patient data were not in the particular children's hospital EHR. The use of informatics approaches to search electronic documentation can result in substantially larger numbers of subjects identified for studies of rare diseases such as DSD, and these approaches can be applied across hospitals."
318,"Does oral supplementation of a fermented papaya preparation correct respiratory burst function of innate immune cells in type 2 diabetes mellitus patients?"
319,"Fermented papaya preparation (FPP) is a nutritional supplement reported to act as an antioxidant by scavenging reactive oxygen species (ROS) and removing 'bad ROS', while inducing ""respiratory burst"" production of necessary 'good ROS'. We sought to investigate the safety of oral administration of FPP (9g/d, 6 weeks) to T2D patients with respect to its effect on the hyperglycemia status of these patients. Peripheral blood was collected during a baseline visit, followed by subsequent collections during and after supplementation. Induced ""respiratory burst"" ROS production was measured at each visit in addition to fasting blood glucose, lipid profile, glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), and lipid/protein peroxidation. Oral FPP supplementation induced ""respiratory burst"" in peripheral blood mononuclear cells while not influencing other blood parameters studied. When human monocytic THP-1 cells were supplemented with sugar-based FPP, cellular ATP and NADPH concentrations were increased while matched glucose alone did not produce similar effects, suggesting a glucose-independent component of FPP to be responsible for increasing cellular energetics. THP-1 cells supplemented with FPP also exhibited higher mitochondrial membrane potential (Deltapsim) and oxygen consumption as compared to cells treated with glucose alone. Taken together, our observations lead to the hypothesis that FPP corrects inducible ""respiratory burst"" function in type 2 diabetes patients."
320,"On Naivety of T Cells in Inflammatory Bowel Disease: A Review."
321,": Little is known about different phases of T-cell maturation in gut mucosa. Based on current knowledge about the migratory pathways of naive and memory T cells, it is believed that access to peripheral, nonlymphoid tissues is restricted to memory T cells. Surprisingly, there is increasing evidence of high numbers of naive T cells in the chronically inflamed gut tissue of patients with inflammatory bowel disease. This could partially be explained by new formation of ectopic lymphoid organs. Ongoing recruitment of naive T cells at inflammatory sites might play a role in the immunopathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease."
322,"Necrotizing Enterocolitis: A Clinical Review on Diagnostic Biomarkers and the Role of the Intestinal Microbiota."
323,"Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) remains one of the most frequent gastrointestinal diseases in the neonatal intensive care unit, with a continuing unacceptable high mortality and morbidity rates. Up to 20% to 40% of infants with NEC will need surgical intervention at some point. Although the exact pathophysiology is not yet elucidated, prematurity, use of formula feeding, and an altered intestinal microbiota are supposed to induce an inflammatory response of the immature intestine. The clinical picture of NEC has been well described. However, an early diagnosis and differentiation against sepsis is challenging. Besides, it is difficult to timely identify NEC cases that will deteriorate and need surgical intervention. This may interfere with the most optimal treatment of infants with NEC. In this review, we discuss the pathogenesis, diagnosis, and treatment of NEC with a focus on the role of microbiota in the development of NEC. An overview of different clinical prediction models and biomarkers is given. Some of these are promising tools for accurate diagnosis of NEC and selection of appropriate therapy."
324,"Anemia in a Population-based IBD Cohort (ICURE): Still High Prevalence After 1 Year, Especially Among Pediatric Patients."
325,"BACKGROUND:: Prevalence of anemia in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is uncertain because of scarcity of population-based studies. The aim of this study was to evaluate prevalence of anemia in a population-based cohort of newly diagnosed patients with IBD to identify risk factors for anemia and to describe contemporary anemia-specific treatment during the first year. METHODS:: All patients with ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease in the IBD Cohort of Uppsala Region cohort (n = 790) and hemoglobin levels at the time of diagnosis were eligible for inclusion. The WHO definition of anemia was used. RESULTS:: Seven hundred forty-nine (95%) of the patients with IBD were included. Five hundred eighty of 749 (77%) patients had measured hemoglobin levels at 12-month follow-up. The prevalence of anemia at the time of diagnosis was 227/749 (30%). After 1 year, it was 102/580 (18%). Anemia was more common among newly diagnosed patients with Crohn's disease compared with ulcerative colitis (42% versus 24%, P < 0.0001), but after 1 year, there was no difference (18% versus 18%, P = NS). Children had more often anemia compared with adults, both at diagnosis and after 1 year (diagnosis: 55% versus 27%, P < 0.0001; follow-up: 28% versus 16%, P < 0.05). Anemia was associated with colonic engagement in Crohn's disease and the extent of inflammation in ulcerative colitis. Only 46% of patients with anemia were treated with iron supplementation or blood transfusion. CONCLUSIONS:: The overall prevalence of anemia in patients with IBD at the time of diagnosis was high. A large proportion was still anemic after 1 year. Children were more at risk compared with adults. More efforts are needed to treat patients with anemia."
326,"Clostridium difficile and Pediatric Inflammatory Bowel Disease: A Prospective, Comparative, Multicenter, ESPGHAN Study."
327,"BACKGROUND:: Clostridium difficile (C. difficile) infection is associated with pediatric inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in several ways. We sought to investigate C. difficile infection in pediatric patients with IBD in comparison with a group of children with celiac disease and to evaluate IBD disease course of C. difficile infected patients. METHODS:: In this prospective, comparative, multicenter study, 211 pediatric patients with IBD were enrolled from October 2010 to October 2011 and tested for the presence of C. difficile toxins A and B in their stools at 0, 6, and 12 months. During the same study period, stool specimens for C. difficile toxins analysis were collected from 112 children with celiac disease as controls. RESULTS:: Clostridium difficile occurrence was significantly higher in patients with IBD compared with patients with celiac disease (7.5% versus 0.8%; P = 0.008). Clostridium difficile was associated with active disease in 71.4% of patients with IBD (P = 0.01). Colonic involvement was found in 85.7% of patients with C. difficile. Antibiotics, proton pump inhibitors, hospitalization, and IBD therapies were not associated with increased C. difficile detection. At 12 months, a higher number of C. difficile-positive patients at the enrollment started immunosuppressant/biological therapy compared with patients without C. difficile (P = 0.01). At 6 and 12 months, patients with C. difficile were more frequently in active disease than patients without C. difficile (P = 0.04; P = 0.08, respectively). Hospitalizations were higher at 6 months in C. difficile group (P = 0.05). CONCLUSIONS:: In conclusion, this study demonstrates that pediatric IBD is associated with increased C. difficile detection. Patients with C. difficile tend to have active colonic disease and a more severe disease course."
328,"Neutrophil/Lymphocyte Ratio Is Associated with Non-Calcified Plaque Burden in Patients with Coronary Artery Disease."
329,"BACKGROUND: Elevations in soluble markers of inflammation and changes in leukocyte subset distribution are frequently reported in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD). Lately, the neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio has emerged as a potential marker of both CAD severity and cardiovascular prognosis. OBJECTIVES: The aim of the study was to investigate whether neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio and other immune-inflammatory markers were related to plaque burden, as assessed by coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA), in patients with CAD. METHODS: Twenty patients with non-ST-elevation acute coronary syndrome (NSTE-ACS) and 30 patients with stable angina (SA) underwent CCTA at two occasions, immediately prior to coronary angiography and after three months. Atherosclerotic plaques were classified as calcified, mixed and non-calcified. Blood samples were drawn at both occasions. Leukocyte subsets were analyzed by white blood cell differential counts and flow cytometry. Levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) and interleukin(IL)-6 were measured in plasma. Blood analyses were also performed in 37 healthy controls. RESULTS: Plaque variables did not change over 3 months, total plaque burden being similar in NSTE-ACS and SA. However, non-calcified/total plaque ratio was higher in NSTE-ACS, 0.25(0.09-0.44) vs 0.11(0.00-0.25), p<0.05. At admission, levels of monocytes, neutrophils, neutrophil/lymphocyte ratios, CD4+ T cells, CRP and IL-6 were significantly elevated, while levels of NK cells were reduced, in both patient groups as compared to controls. After 3 months, levels of monocytes, neutrophils, neutrophil/lymphocyte ratios and CD4+ T cells remained elevated in patients. Neutrophil/lymphocyte ratios and neutrophil counts correlated significantly with numbers of non-calcified plaques and also with non-calcified/total plaque ratio (r = 0.403, p = 0.010 and r = 0.382, p = 0.024, respectively), but not with total plaque burden. CONCLUSIONS: Among immune-inflammatory markers in NSTE-ACS and SA patients, neutrophil counts and neutrophil/lymphocyte ratios were significantly correlated with non-calcified plaques. Data suggest that these easily measured biomarkers reflect the burden of vulnerable plaques in CAD."
330,"Dynamic Contrast Enhanced MRI Detects Early Response to Adoptive NK Cellular Immunotherapy Targeting the NG2 Proteoglycan in a Rat Model of Glioblastoma."
331,"There are currently no established radiological parameters that predict response to immunotherapy. We hypothesised that multiparametric, longitudinal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of physiological parameters and pharmacokinetic models might detect early biological responses to immunotherapy for glioblastoma targeting NG2/CSPG4 with mAb9.2.27 combined with natural killer (NK) cells. Contrast enhanced conventional T1-weighted MRI at 7+/-1 and 17+/-2 days post-treatment failed to detect differences in tumour size between the treatment groups, whereas, follow-up scans at 3 months demonstrated diminished signal intensity and tumour volume in the surviving NK+mAb9.2.27 treated animals. Notably, interstitial volume fraction (ve), was significantly increased in the NK+mAb9.2.27 combination therapy group compared mAb9.2.27 and NK cell monotherapy groups (p = 0.002 and p = 0.017 respectively) in cohort 1 animals treated with 1 million NK cells. ve was reproducibly increased in the combination NK+mAb9.2.27 compared to NK cell monotherapy in cohort 2 treated with increased dose of 2 million NK cells (p<0.0001), indicating greater cell death induced by NK+mAb9.2.27 treatment. The interstitial volume fraction in the NK monotherapy group was significantly reduced compared to mAb9.2.27 monotherapy (p<0.0001) and untreated controls (p = 0.014) in the cohort 2 animals. NK cells in monotherapy were unable to kill the U87MG cells that highly expressed class I human leucocyte antigens, and diminished stress ligands for activating receptors. A significant association between apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) of water and ve in combination NK+mAb9.2.27 and NK monotherapy treated tumours was evident, where increased ADC corresponded to reduced ve in both cases. Collectively, these data support histological measures at end-stage demonstrating diminished tumour cell proliferation and pronounced apoptosis in the NK+mAb9.2.27 treated tumours compared to the other groups. In conclusion, ve was the most reliable radiological parameter for detecting response to intralesional NK cellular therapy."
332,"POSTOPERATIVE CYSTOGRAM FINDINGS PREDICT INCONTINENCE FOLLOWING ROBOT-ASSISTED RADICAL PROSTATECTOMY."
333,"Introduction: The factors that contribute to continence following robot-assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP) are currently being investigated. The purpose of this study is to determine the relationship of the bladder neck location on postoperative cystogram to subsequent continence rates following RARP. Materials and Methods: A retrospective review of 611 consecutive RARP patients identified 215 patients with a postoperative cystogram. A ratio was created by measuring the distance from the superior edge of the pubic symphysis to the bladder neck and dividing it by the total pubic symphysis height, termed bladder neck to pubic symphysis ratio (BNPS). Odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals were calculated for the relationship between incontinence and BNPS tertile categories. Results: At 3 month follow-up, continent patients had a mean BNPS ratio of 0.39 (95% C.I. 0.35-0.43), while incontinent patients had a mean BNPS ratio of 0.49 (95% C.I. 0.42-0.56; p=0.01). At 12 months, the mean BNPS ratio was 0.40 (95% C.I. 0.37-0.44) for continent patients, whereas incontinent patients had a mean BNPS ratio of 0.60 (95% C.I. 0.43-0.77; p=0.001). When analyzed as tertile groups, the corresponding incontinence rates at 12 months, were 2.8%, 2.8%, and 19.4% for the lowest, middle and highest BNPS tertiles, respectively. Conclusions: Post-prostatectomy bladder neck location defined by the BNPS ratio on cystogram correlates with continence rates and may predict patients at risk for prolonged incontinence. Efforts designed to preserve support of the bladder neck and sphincteric complex in relation to the pubic symphysis may improve both early and late continence."
334,"An Image-Based Genetic Assay Identifies Genes in T1D Susceptibility Loci Controlling Cellular Antiviral Immunity in Mouse."
335,"The pathogenesis of complex diseases, such as type 1 diabetes (T1D), derives from interactions between host genetics and environmental factors. Previous studies have suggested that viral infection plays a significant role in initiation of T1D in genetically predisposed individuals. T1D susceptibility loci may therefore be enriched in previously uncharacterized genes functioning in antiviral defense pathways. To identify genes involved in antiviral immunity, we performed an image-based high-throughput genetic screen using short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) against 161 genes within T1D susceptibility loci. RAW 264.7 cells transduced with shRNAs were infected with GFP-expressing herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) and fluorescent microscopy was performed to assess the viral infectivity by fluorescence reporter activity. Of the 14 candidates identified with high confidence, two candidates were selected for further investigation, Il27 and Tagap. Administration of recombinant IL-27 during viral infection was found to act synergistically with interferon gamma (IFN-gamma) to activate expression of type I IFNs and proinflammatory cytokines, and to enhance the activities of interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3). Consistent with a role in antiviral immunity, Tagap-deficient macrophages demonstrated increased viral replication, reduced expression of proinflammatory chemokines and cytokines, and decreased production of IFN-beta. Taken together, our unbiased loss-of-function genetic screen identifies genes that play a role in host antiviral immunity and delineates roles for IL-27 and Tagap in the production of antiviral cytokines."
336,"Right or Left: The Role of Nanoparticles in Pulmonary Diseases."
337,"Due to the rapid development of the nanotechnology industry in the last decade, nanoparticles (NPs) are omnipresent in our everyday life today. Many nanomaterials have been engineered for medical purposes. These purposes include therapy for pulmonary diseases. On other hand, people are endeavoring to develop nanomaterials for improvement or replacement of traditional therapies. On the other hand, nanoparticles, as foreign material in human bodies, are reported to have potential adverse effects on the lung, including oxidase stress, inflammation, fibrosis and genotoxicity. Further, these damages could induce pulmonary diseases and even injuries in other tissues. It seems that nanoparticles may exert two-sided effects. Toxic effects of nanomaterials should be considered when their use is developed for therapies. Hence this review will attempt to summarize the two-side roles of nanoparticles in both therapies for pulmonary diseases and initiation of lung diseases and even secondary diseases caused by lung injuries. Determinants of these effects such as physicochemical properties of nanoparticles will also be discussed."
338,"Discovery and in Vivo Evaluation of Novel RGD-Modified Lipid-Polymer Hybrid Nanoparticles for Targeted Drug Delivery."
339,"In the current study, the lipid-shell and polymer-core hybrid nanoparticles (lpNPs) modified by Arg-Gly-Asp(RGD) peptide, loaded with curcumin (Cur), were developed by emulsification-solvent volatilization method. The RGD-modified hybrid nanoparticles (RGD-lpNPs) could overcome the poor water solubility of Cur to meet the requirement of intravenous administration and tumor active targeting. The obtained optimal RGD-lpNPs, composed of PLGA (poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid))-mPEG (methoxyl poly(ethylene- glycol)), RGD-polyethylene glycol (PEG)-cholesterol (Chol) copolymers and lipids, had good entrapment efficiency, submicron size and negatively neutral surface charge. The core-shell structure of RGD-lpNPs was verified by TEM. Cytotoxicity analysis demonstrated that the RGD-lpNPs encapsulated Cur retained potent anti-tumor effects. Flow cytometry analysis revealed the cellular uptake of Cur encapsulated in the RGD-lpNPs was increased for human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC). Furthermore, Cur loaded RGD-lpNPs were more effective in inhibiting tumor growth in a subcutaneous B16 melanoma tumor model. The results of immunofluorescent and immunohistochemical studies by Cur loaded RGD-lpNPs therapies indicated that more apoptotic cells, fewer microvessels, and fewer proliferation-positive cells were observed. In conclusion, RGD-lpNPs encapsulating Cur were developed with enhanced anti-tumor activity in melanoma, and Cur loaded RGD-lpNPs represent an excellent tumor targeted formulation of Cur which might be an attractive candidate for cancer therapy."
340,"A Proteomic Analysis of Human Follicular Fluid: Comparison between Younger and Older Women with Normal FSH Levels."
341,"The follicular fluid (FF) is produced during folliculogenesis and contains a variety of proteins that play important roles in follicle development and oocyte maturation. Age-related infertility is usually considered as a problem that can be solved by assisted reproduction technology. Therefore, the identi fi cation of novel biomarkers that are linked to reproductive aging is the subject of this study. FF was obtained from healthy younger (20-32 years old) and older (38-42 years old) women undergoing intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) due to male factor infertility. The FF was analyzed by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE). The power of two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and the identi fi cation of proteins were exploited using matrix-assisted laser desorption-ionization time-of-flight/time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF-TOF) mass spectrometry. Twenty three protein spots showed reproducible and significant changes in the aged compared to the young group. Of these, 19 protein spots could be identified using MALDI-TOF-TOF-MS. As a result of MASCOT search, five unique downregulated proteins were identified in the older group. These were identified as serotransferrin, hemopexin precursor, complement C3, C4 and kininogen. A number of protein markers were found that may help develop diagnostic methods of infertility."
342,"A Functional Polymorphism in the 3'-UTR of PXR Interacts with Smoking to Increase Lung Cancer Risk in Southern and Eastern Chinese Smoker."
343,"Pregnane X receptor (PXR) is an important member of the nuclear receptor superfamily that copes with various endobiotic and xenobiotic stimuli, such as carcinogens by regulating an array of environmental response genes. Low PXR expression has been shown to promote tumor initiation and metastasis. The aim of the current study was to investigate whether the single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of PXR could alter lung cancer susceptibility in Chinese by affecting the function or expression of PXR. We genotyped three putatively functional SNPs of PXR (i.e., rs3814055C>T, rs3732360C>T, and rs3814058C>T) and analyzed their associations with lung cancer risk in a two-stage case-control study with a total of 1559 lung cancer cases and 1679 controls in the southern and eastern Chinese population. We found that in comparison to the rs3814058CC common genotype, the rs3814058T variants (TC/TT) which is located in the 3'-untranslated region (3'-UTR) of PXR conferred a consistently increased risk of lung cancer in both the southern Chinese (odd ratios (OR) = 1.24, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.03-1.49) and the eastern Chinese (OR = 1.33, 95% CI = 1.02-1.75). The variants also significantly interacted with smoking on increasing cancer risk (p = 0.023). Moreover, lung cancer tissues with the rs3814058T variants showed significantly lower PXR expression than those with rs3814058CC genotype in the smokers (p = 0.041). These results suggested that the rs3814058C>T polymorphism of PXR interacts with smoking on increasing lung cancer risk in Chinese smokers, which might be a functional genetic biomarker for lung cancer."
344,"The Biological Function and Clinical Utilization of CD147 in Human Diseases: A Review of the Current Scientific Literature."
345,"CD147 or EMMPRIN is a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily in humans. It is widely expressed in human tumors and plays a central role in the progression of many cancers by stimulating the secretion of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and cytokines. CD147 regulates cell proliferation, apoptosis, and tumor cell migration, metastasis and differentiation, especially under hypoxic conditions. CD147 is also important to many organ systems. This review will provide a detailed overview of the discovery, characterization, molecular structure, diverse biological functions and regulatory mechanisms of CD147 in human physiological and pathological processes. In particular, recent studies have demonstrated the potential application of CD147 not only as a phenotypic marker of activated regulatory T cells but also as a potential diagnostic marker for early-stage disease. Moreover, CD147 is recognized as an effective therapeutic target for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and other cancers, and exciting clinical progress has been made in HCC treatment using CD147-directed monoclonal antibodies."
346,"Gender-Associated Genomic Differences in Colorectal Cancer: Clinical Insight from Feminization of Male Cancer Cells."
347,"Gender-related differences in colorectal cancer (CRC) are not fully understood. Recent studies have shown that CRC arising in females are significantly associated with CpG island methylator phenotype (CIMP-high). Using array comparative genomic hybridization, we analyzed a cohort of 116 CRCs (57 males, 59 females) for chromosomal copy number aberrations (CNA) and found that CRC in females had significantly higher numbers of gains involving chromosome arms 1q21.2-q21.3, 4q13.2, 6p21.1 and 16p11.2 and copy number losses of chromosome arm 11q25 compared to males. Interestingly, a subset of male CRCs (46%) exhibited a ""feminization"" phenomenon in the form of gains of X chromosomes (or an arm of X) and/or losses of the Y chromosome. Feminization of cancer cells was significantly associated with microsatellite-stable CRCs (p-value 0.003) and wild-type BRAF gene status (p-value 0.009). No significant association with other clinicopathological parameters was identified including disease-free survival. In summary, our data show that some CNAs in CRC may be gender specific and that male cancers characterized by feminization may constitute a specific subset of CRCs that warrants further investigation."
348,"Effect of APE1 T2197G (Asp148Glu) Polymorphism on APE1, XRCC1, PARP1 and OGG1 Expression in Patients with Colorectal Cancer."
349,"It has been hypothesized that genetic variation in base excision repair (BER) might modify colorectal adenoma risk. Thus, we evaluated the influence of APE1 T2197G (Asp148Glu) polymorphism on APE1, XRCC1, PARP1 and OGG1 expression in normal and tumor samples from patients with colorectal cancer. The results indicate a downregulation of OGG1 and an upregulation of XRCC1 expression in tumor tissue. Regarding the anatomical location of APE1, OGG1 and PARP-1, a decrease in gene expression was observed among patients with cancer in the rectum. In patients with or without some degree of tumor invasion, a significant downregulation in OGG1 was observed in tumor tissue. Interestingly, when taking into account the tumor stage, patients with more advanced grades (III and IV) showed a significant repression for APE1, OGG1 and PARP-1. XRCC1 expression levels were significantly enhanced in tumor samples and were correlated with all clinical and histopathological data. Concerning the polymorphism T2197G, GG genotype carriers exhibited a significantly reduced expression of genes of the BER repair system (APE1, XRCC1 and PARP1). In summary, our data show that patients with colorectal cancer present expression changes in several BER genes, suggesting a role for APE1, XRCC1, PARP1 and OGG1 and APE1 polymorphism in colorectal carcinogenesis."

352,"Data on the Safety of Psoriasis Therapies."
353,"Safety remains paramount to the clinical utility of a therapy. Evaluation of safety is an ongoing process that does not end when a therapy becomes commercially available. This article reviews recent data pertaining to the safety profile of two therapeutic classes widely used in the treatment of psoriasis: inhibitors of tumor necrosis factor-alpha and agents that target interleukin-12/23."
354,"Therapeutic Development in Psoriasis."
355,"Advances in molecular biology have provided the basis for development of new therapeutic approaches to psoriasis. New, more effective therapies target specific molecules in the inflammatory cascade involved in the pathogenesis of psoriasis.The biologic era of psoriasis therapy began with inhibitors of T-cell activation, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and interleukin (IL)-12/23. Continued investigation has led to therapies and therapeutic candidates that target IL-17, IL-23, phosphodiesterase-4, and isomers of Janus kinase."
356,"The Role of TNF Inhibitors in Psoriatic Disease."
357,"In contrast to many other diseases, modern psoriasis therapy has a fairly brief history. Until about 15 years ago, clinicians and their patients had few options, with limited ability to rein in the disease process.The success of antifolate methotrexate in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) led to clinical evaluation and adoption of the agent, a principal form of treatment for psoriasis, which, like RA, has its origin based in inflammation. The introduction of tumor necrosis factor-alpha inhibitors marked the beginning of the biologic era of psoriasis therapy. Also borrowed from the field of rheumatology, biologic therapy has evolved from improved understanding of the molecular basis of the disease process. An increased recognition of comorbid conditions that often accompany psoriasis, particularly psoriatic arthritis, can complicate clin-ical management. Dermatologists and other clinicians who treat psoriasis continue to benefit from insights gained in the field of rheumatology."
358,"ZFC3H1, a Zinc Finger Protein, Modulates IL-8 Transcription by Binding with Celastramycin A, a Potential Immune Suppressor."
359,"Celastramycin A, a small molecule that inhibits the production of antibacterial peptides in an ex vivo culture system of Drosophila, suppresses the TNFalpha-mediated induction of IL-8 in mammalian cells. To understand its molecular mechanism, we examined Celastramycin A binding proteins and investigated their biological functions. Our screening and subsequent pull-down assay revealed ZFC3H1 (also known as CCDC131 or CSRC2), an uncharacterized zinc finger protein, as a Celastramycin A binding protein. The knockdown of ZFC3H1 reduced IL-8 expression levels in the TNFalpha-stimulated lung carcinoma cell line, LU99, and UV-irradiated HeLa cells. Based on reporter assay results, we concluded that ZFC3H1 participates in the transcriptional activation of IL-8. The findings of our UV-irradiation experiments implied that ZFC3H1 may indirectly interact with ERCC1 in an activated DNA repair complex. Thus, we designated ZFC3H1 as a mammalian target of Celastramycin A (mTOC)."
360,"Glioma: Application of Whole-Tumor Texture Analysis of Diffusion-Weighted Imaging for the Evaluation of Tumor Heterogeneity."
361,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: To apply a texture analysis of apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps to evaluate glioma heterogeneity, which was correlated with tumor grade. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty patients with glioma (WHO grade II (n = 8), grade III (n = 10) and grade IV (n = 22)) underwent diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), and the corresponding ADC maps were obtained. Regions of interest containing the lesions were drawn on every section of the ADC map containing the tumor, and volume-based data of the entire tumor were constructed. Texture and first order features including entropy, skewness and kurtosis were derived from the ADC map using in-house software. A histogram analysis of the ADC map was also performed. The texture and histogram parameters were compared between low-grade and high-grade gliomas using an unpaired student's t-test. Additionally, a one-way analysis of variance analysis with a post-hoc test was performed to compare the parameters of each grade. RESULTS: Entropy was observed to be significantly higher in high-grade gliomas than low-grade tumors (6.861+/-0.539 vs. 6.261+/-0.412, P = 0.006). The fifth percentiles of the ADC cumulative histogram also showed a significant difference between high and low grade gliomas (836+/-235 vs. 1030+/-185, P = 0.037). Only entropy proved to be significantly different between grades III and IV (6.295+/-0.4963 vs. 7.119+/-0.3165, P<0.001). The diagnostic accuracy of ADC entropy was significantly higher than that of the fifth percentile of the ADC histogram (P = 0.0034) in distinguishing high- from low-grade glioma. CONCLUSION: A texture analysis of the ADC map based on the entire tumor volume can be useful for evaluating glioma grade, which provides tumor heterogeneity."
362,"IgM-Antibodies against Phosphorylcholine in Mothers and Normal or Low Birth Weight Term Newborn Infants."
363,"OBJECTIVE: To determine levels of athero-protective IgM antibodies against phosphorylcholine in mothers and term-born normal or low birth weight infants. APPROACH: Twenty three mother-infant pairs were studied, of whom 16 infants were within the normal weight range for gestational age (NGA; 3652[504] g) and 7 were small for gestational age (SGA; birth weight: 2715[255] g), the latter <2SD below the Swedish reference data mean for normal fetal growth. All infants were born at term (mean+/-SD 40.5+/-1.1 weeks). Serum was available from 6 mothers with SGA and 14 with NGA infants. Participating mothers were aged 34.0+/-3.9 years (no difference between groups). Fourteen neonates were boys and seven were girls. Levels of anti-PC IgM were determined by ELISA. RESULTS: Neonatal IgM anti-PC levels were low (undetectable in 8 infants out of which 3 were SGA) with a median of 76[range 0-2.51] U/ml. Maternal IgM anti-PC levels were significantly higher (median 7198[range: 25.32-656.0]) U/ml) and the proportion of mothers in highest quartile (>75th percentile) was larger in mothers of NGA-infants (43%) vs. those of SGA-infants (0%, p = 0.032). CONCLUSIONS: IgM anti-PC levels are low at birth, which suggests that these antibodies do not play a ""housekeeping"" role in immune function during fetal life/development, but arise predominately on exposure to external antigens after birth. Furthermore, low maternal IgM anti-PC levels may play a role in placental insufficiency, contributing to poor fetal growth and a small-for-date baby. This preliminary observation may have implications for the future risk of atherosclerosis/cardiovascular disease development in pregnant women and their offspring."
364,"Psoriatic Inflammation Facilitates the Onset of Arthritis in a Mouse Model."
365,"Psoriatic arthritis (PsA) is a seronegative, inflammatory joint disease associated with psoriasis. In most patients with PsA, skin lesions precede arthritis; however, the causality of skin inflammation for the development of arthritis remains unclear. Gp130F759/F759 knock-in (F759) mice develop autoimmune arthritis after 1 year of age through persistent Stat3 activation due to impairment in SOCS3-dependent negative regulation. Here, we crossed F759 mice with K5.Stat3C transgenic mice, in which keratinocytes express constitutive active Stat3 (Stat3C) leading to generation of psoriasis-like skin change. F759 mice harboring the K5.Stat3C transgene not only had aggravated skin lesions but also spontaneously developed arthritis with high penetrance in adjacent paws as early as 3 weeks of age. The joint lesions included swelling of the peripheral paws and nail deformities contiguous with the skin lesions, closely resembling PsA. Histopathologic study revealed enthesitis and bone erosions, with mononuclear cell infiltrates. qRT-PCR, immunohistochemical analyses, and flow cytometry showed up-regulation of the IL-23/Th17 pathway in affected joints. Furthermore, enforced generation of psoriasis-like skin inflammation by topical treatment with 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) in F759 mice induced swelling of the underlying joints. This animal model renders psoriatic inflammation as the driver of arthritis and helps to further understand the pathogenesis of PsA.Journal of Investigative Dermatology accepted article preview online, 30 September 2014; doi:10.1038/jid.2014.426."
366,"CisMiner: Genome-Wide In-Silico Cis-Regulatory Module Prediction by Fuzzy Itemset Mining."
367,"Eukaryotic gene control regions are known to be spread throughout non-coding DNA sequences which may appear distant from the gene promoter. Transcription factors are proteins that coordinately bind to these regions at transcription factor binding sites to regulate gene expression. Several tools allow to detect significant co-occurrences of closely located binding sites (cis-regulatory modules, CRMs). However, these tools present at least one of the following limitations: 1) scope limited to promoter or conserved regions of the genome; 2) do not allow to identify combinations involving more than two motifs; 3) require prior information about target motifs. In this work we present CisMiner, a novel methodology to detect putative CRMs by means of a fuzzy itemset mining approach able to operate at genome-wide scale. CisMiner allows to perform a blind search of CRMs without any prior information about target CRMs nor limitation in the number of motifs. CisMiner tackles the combinatorial complexity of genome-wide cis-regulatory module extraction using a natural representation of motif combinations as itemsets and applying the Top-Down Fuzzy Frequent- Pattern Tree algorithm to identify significant itemsets. Fuzzy technology allows CisMiner to better handle the imprecision and noise inherent to regulatory processes. Results obtained for a set of well-known binding sites in the S. cerevisiae genome show that our method yields highly reliable predictions. Furthermore, CisMiner was also applied to putative in-silico predicted transcription factor binding sites to identify significant combinations in S. cerevisiae and D. melanogaster, proving that our approach can be further applied genome-wide to more complex genomes. CisMiner is freely accesible at: http://genome2.ugr.es/cisminer. CisMiner can be queried for the results presented in this work and can also perform a customized cis-regulatory module prediction on a query set of transcription factor binding sites provided by the user."
368,"CD4+ T Cells Expressing Latency-Associated Peptide and Foxp3 Are an Activated Subgroup of Regulatory T Cells Enriched in Patients with Colorectal Cancer."
369,"Latency-associated peptide (LAP) - expressing regulatory T cells (Tregs) are important for immunological self-tolerance and immune homeostasis. In order to investigate the role of LAP in human CD4+Foxp3+ Tregs, we designed a cross-sectional study that involved 42 colorectal cancer (CRC) patients. The phenotypes, cytokine-release patterns, and suppressive ability of Tregs isolated from peripheral blood and tumor tissues were analyzed. We found that the population of LAP-positive CD4+Foxp3+ Tregs significantly increased in peripheral blood and cancer tissues of CRC patients as compared to that in the peripheral blood and tissues of healthy subjects. Both LAP+ and LAP- Tregs had a similar effector/memory phenotype. However, LAP+ Tregs expressed more effector molecules, including tumor necrosis factor receptor II, granzyme B, perforin, Ki67, and CCR5, than their LAP- negative counterparts. The in vitro immunosuppressive activity of LAP+ Tregs, exerted via a transforming growth factor-beta-mediated mechanism, was more potent than that of LAP- Tregs. Furthermore, the enrichment of LAP+ Treg population in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of CRC patients correlated with cancer metastases. In conclusion, we found that LAP+ Foxp3+ CD4+ Treg cells represented an activated subgroup of Tregs having more potent regulatory activity in CRC patients. The increased frequency of LAP+ Tregs in PBMCs of CRC patients suggests their potential role in controlling immune response to cancer and presents LAP as a marker of tumor-specific Tregs in CRC patients."
370,"Characteristics of nonylphenol and bisphenol A accumulation by fish and implications for ecological and human health."
371,"Fish populations constitute an important part of aquatic ecosystems. Thus, their accumulation of nonylphenol (NP) and bisphenol A (BPA) may pose risks to ecosystems and human health. This study analyzed the concentrations of NP and BPA in four types of fishes (i.e., wild/farmed freshwater fishes and wild/farmed marine fishes). Wild freshwater fishes contained higher concentrations of NP and BPA than the other three types of fishes. The concentrations of NP in the wild freshwater fishes ranged from 1.01 to 277mug/kg ww, with bioconcentration factors (BCFs) and biota-sediment accumulation factors (BSAFs) ranging from 74.0 to 2.60x104L/kg and from 0.003 to 18.3, respectively. The wild freshwater fishes contained relatively low amounts of BPA, varying from ND to 25.2mug/kg ww, with the BCFs and BSAFs ranging from 1.00 to 274L/kg and from 0.003 to 3.40, respectively. Five fish species particularly showed high BCFs and BSAFs, indicating that they could be an important source of NP for higher trophic levels, most likely resulting in ecological risks. The demersal fishes showed a greater ability to accumulate NP than the pelagic ones. The fact that the 95th percentile values of the risk quotient (RQ) for NP and BPA were higher than the acceptable threshold indicated that these two compounds would have adverse effects on aquatic organisms in Taiwanese rivers. The consumption of wild marine fishes had the highest 95th percentile values of hazard quotient (HQ) for NP and BPA among the four types of fishes, particularly for the population aged 0-3years. However, the 95th percentile values of HQ for NP and BPA were all less than 1, suggesting that exposure to NP and BPA through fish consumption posed no remarkable risk to human health in Taiwan."
372,"Which luteal phase support is better for each IVF stimulation protocol to achieve the highest pregnancy rate? A superiority randomized clinical trial."
373,"Abstract In vitro fertilization (IVF) cycles generate abnormalities in luteal-phase sex steroid concentrations and this represent an important limiting factor to achieve a good pregnancy rate. Although there are evidences about the usefulness of luteal phase support (LPS) after IVF cycles, no consensus exist about the best dose and way of progesterone (PG) administration, the advantages of estradiol (E2) supplementation and which IVF protocol could benefit from one more than other LPS scheme. Aim of the study was to assess the best LPS (low-dose PG, high-dose PG, high-dose PG and E2 supplementation) to achieve the highest clinical/ongoing pregnancy rate according to stimulation protocol, E2 at ovulation induction, endometrial thickness at pick-up and women's age. We conducted a randomized trial on 360 women undergoing IVF (180 treated by long-GnRH agonist, 90 by short-GnRH agonist and 90 by short-GnRH antagonist protocol) and stimulated by recombinant follicle-stimulating hormone alone. Our data demonstrated that high-dose PG is better than low-dose to increase both clinical and ongoing pregnancy rate. E2 supplementation are mandatory in case of short-GnRH antagonist protocol and strongly suggested in all protocols when E2max <5 nmol/l and endometrial thickness <10 mm. In long-GnRH agonist protocols, as well as in patients >35 years, the real advantages of E2 supplementation remain debatable and require further confirmation."
374,"The menstrual cycle regularization following d-chiro-inositol treatment in PCOS women: a retrospective study."
375,"Abstract Polycystic ovary syndrome is characterized by irregular cycles, hyperandrogenism, polycystic ovary at ultrasound and insulin resistance. The effectiveness of d-chiro-inositol (DCI) treatment in improving insulin resistance in PCOS patients has been confirmed in several reports. The objective of this study was to retrospectively analyze the effect of DCI on menstrual cycle regularity in PCOS women. This was a retrospective study of patients with irregular cycles who were treated with DCI. Of all PCOS women admitted to our centre, 47 were treated with DCI and had complete medical charts. The percentage of women reporting regular menstrual cycles significantly increased with increasing duration of DCI treatment (24% and 51.6% at a mean of 6 and 15 months of treatment, respectively). Serum AMH levels and indexes of insulin resistance significantly decreased during the treatment. Low AMH levels, high HOMA index, and the presence of oligomenorrhea at the first visit were the independent predictors of obtaining regular menstrual cycle with DCI. In conclusion, the use of DCI is associated to clinical benefits for many women affected by PCOS including the improvement in insulin resistance and menstrual cycle regularity. Responders to the treatment may be identified on the basis of menstrual irregularity and hormonal or metabolic markers."
376,"The role of free triiodothyronine in pathogenesis of infertility in levothyroxine-treated women with thyroid autoimmunity - a preliminary observational study."
377,"Abstract Introduction: The aim of this study was to analyze the possible role of free triiodothyronine (FT3) in infertility and in levothyroxine-treated (LT4) euthyroid women with Hashimoto thyroiditis (HT). Methods: It is an observational retrospective case control study. Twenty one euthyroid women with HT on LT4 replacement therapy and a medical history of idiopathic infertility were included into the study. To achieve higher FT3 level, the dose of LT4 was increased in every patient. Fifteen fertile women with HT on LT4 replacement therapy served as a control group. Results: At baseline in the study group mean thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) level was 1.96 muU/ml +/- 0.84 muU/ml and mean FT3 was 4.07 pmol/l +/- 0.78 pmol/l. The mean TSH level after the increase of LT4 was 0.60 muU/ml +/- 0.45 muU/ml (p < 0.0001), and the mean FT3 was 5.12 pmol/l +/- 0.77 pmol/l (p = 0.0001). Baseline TSH in the study group was higher than in controls (p < 0.0001) and baseline FT3 in the study group was lower than in controls (p = 0.0003). Conclusions: Relatively low levels of FT3 in women with HT on LT4 replacement therapy may contribute to higher infertility rates."
378,"Trehalose- and glucose-derived glycoamphiphiles: small-molecule and nanoparticle Toll-like Receptor 4 (TLR4) modulators."
379,"An increasing number of pathologies have been linked to Toll-like Receptor 4 (TLR4) activation and signaling. New hit and lead compounds that target the TLR4 activation process are urgently needed. We report on the synthesis and biological properties of protonatable glycolipids based on glucose and trehalose scaffolds. Some of these compounds potently inhibit TLR4 activation and signaling in cells transfected with human and mouse variants of TLR4, MD-2 and CD14 receptors and are active in inhibiting TLR4-dependent cytokine production in vivo. Structure-activity relationship studies indicate that the presence of fatty ester chains in the molecule is a primary prerequisite for biological activity in this family of compounds and points to facial amphiphilicity as a preferred architecture for TLR4 antagonist design. Experimental data also support that single molecules, and not micellar aggregates, are the active species. Because the cationic glycolipids here presented exhibit negligible toxicity at their active concentrations, they can be considered as new lead compounds for the development of drugs targeting TLR4 activation and signaling in infectious, inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. Interestingly, the biological activity of the best drug candidate was retained after adsorption at the surface of colloidal gold nanoparticles, broadening the options for clinical development."
380,"Lexical tone and stuttering loci in Mandarin: Evidence from preschool children who stutter."
381,"Abstract The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between stuttering loci and lexical tone in Mandarin-speaking preschoolers. Conversational samples from 20 Taiwanese children who stutter (CWS; M = 4:9; range = 3:2-6:4) were analysed for frequency and type of speech disfluency and lexical tone associated with stuttering-like disfluencies (SLDs). Results indicated that SLDs were significantly more likely to be produced on Mandarin syllables carrying Tone 3 and Tone 4 syllables compared to syllables carrying either Tone 1 or Tone 2. Post-hoc analyses revealed: (1) no significant differences in the stuttering frequencies between Tone 1 and Tone 2, or between Tone 3 and Tone 4, and (2) a higher incidence of stuttering on syllables carrying Tone 3 and Tone 4 embedded in conflicting (as opposed to compatible) tonal contexts. Results suggest that the higher incidence of stuttering on Mandarin syllables carrying either Tone 3 or 4 may be attributed to the increased level of speech motor demand underlying rapid F0 change both within and across syllables."
382,"The Postconcussion Symptom Scale: Utility of a Three-Factor Structure."
383,"PURPOSE: To determine the factor structure of a 19-item Post-Concussion Symptom Scale (PCSS) and examine associations between factor scores and gender, previous history of concussion, and length of time since injury. METHODS: Retrospective medical record review of pediatric patients with concussion seen in a sports medicine clinic from April 2008 to September 2012. We performed an exploratory factor analysis (EFA) followed by a confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). Analysis of variance (ANOVA) and regression analysis were used to examine associations between factor scores and gender, previous history of concussion, mood disorder, anxiety disorder or attention deficit disorder (ADD), and length of time since injury. RESULTS: EFA supported a 3-factor solution for post-concussive symptoms employing 18 of the original 19 scale items. Factor 1 consisted of eight cognition-related items, factor 2 consisted of six somatic-related items, and factor 3 consisted of four emotional-related items. CFA results confirmed the unidimensionality of factors 1 (neurocognitive), 2 (somatic) and 3 (emotional), with factor 3 being considered borderline. Females and patients with anxiety disorders had significantly worse (higher) scores on all three factors. Patients seen more than 14 days following the concussive injury had worse (higher) factor 3 (emotional) scores than those seen fewer than 14 days after the injury. There was no significant difference in post-concussion symptom factor structures between those with and without a previous history of concussion. CONCLUSION: Our investigation demonstrates a consistent symptom 3-factor structure of the PCSS in pediatric patients with concussions. Females and patients with anxiety disorders had higher scores than males for all 3 factors. Patients seen more than 14 days following concussive injury had higher scores for emotional symptoms, suggesting that prolonged concussion symptoms may affect emotional health."

388,"Synthesis and Characterization of Novel 2-Amino-Chromene-Nitriles that Target Bcl-2 in Acute Myeloid Leukemia Cell Lines."
389,"The anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 is a well-known and attractive therapeutic target for cancer. In the present study the solution-phase T3P-DMSO mediated efficient synthesis of 2-amino-chromene-3-carbonitriles from alcohols, malanonitrile and phenols is reported. These novel 2-amino-chromene-3-carbonitriles showed cytotoxicity in human acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cell lines. Compound 4g was found to be the most bioactive, decreasing growth and increasing apoptosis of AML cells. Moreover, compound 4g (at a concentration of 5 microM) increased the G2/M and sub-G1 (apoptosis) phases of AML cells. The AML cells treated with compound 4g exhibited decreased levels of Bcl-2 and increased levels of caspase-9. In silico molecular interaction analysis showed that compound 4g shared a similar global binding motif with navitoclax (another small molecule that binds Bcl-2), however compound 4g occupies a smaller volume within the P2 hot spot of Bcl-2. The intermolecular pi-stacking interaction, direct electrostatic interactions, and docking energy predicted for 4g in complex with Bcl-2 suggest a strong affinity of the complex, rendering 4g as a promising Bcl-2 inhibitor for evaluation as a new anticancer agent."
390,"Simvastatin in the Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome."
391,"Background Studies in animals and in vitro and phase 2 studies in humans suggest that statins may be beneficial in the treatment of the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). This study tested the hypothesis that treatment with simvastatin would improve clinical outcomes in patients with ARDS. Methods In this multicenter, double-blind clinical trial, we randomly assigned (in a 1:1 ratio) patients with an onset of ARDS within the previous 48 hours to receive enteral simvastatin at a dose of 80 mg or placebo once daily for a maximum of 28 days. The primary outcome was the number of ventilator-free days to day 28. Secondary outcomes included the number of days free of nonpulmonary organ failure to day 28, mortality at 28 days, and safety. Results The study recruited 540 patients, with 259 patients assigned to simvastatin and 281 to placebo. The groups were well matched with respect to demographic and baseline physiological variables. There was no significant difference between the study groups in the mean (+/-SD) number of ventilator-free days (12.6+/-9.9 with simvastatin and 11.5+/-10.4 with placebo, P=0.21) or days free of nonpulmonary organ failure (19.4+/-11.1 and 17.8+/-11.7, respectively; P=0.11) or in mortality at 28 days (22.0% and 26.8%, respectively; P=0.23). There was no significant difference between the two groups in the incidence of serious adverse events related to the study drug. Conclusions Simvastatin therapy, although safe and associated with minimal adverse effects, did not improve clinical outcomes in patients with ARDS.

392,"Chromium in Drinking Water: Association with Biomarkers of Exposure and Effect."
393,"An epidemiological cross-sectional study was conducted in Greece to investigate health outcomes associated with long-term exposure to chromium via drinking water. The study population consisted of 304 participants. Socio-demographics, lifestyle, drinking water intake, dietary habits, occupational and medical history data were recorded through a personal interview. Physical examination and a motor test were carried out on the individuals. Total chromium concentrations were measured in blood and hair of the study subjects. Hematological, biochemical and inflammatory parameters were determined in blood. Chromium in drinking water ranged from <0.5 to 90 mug.L-1 in all samples but one (220 mug.L-1), with a median concentration of 21.2 mug.L-1. Chromium levels in blood (median 0.32 mug.L-1, range <0.18-0.92 mug.L-1) and hair (median 0.22 mug.g-1, range 0.03-1.26 mug.g-1) were found within ""normal range"" according to the literature. Personal lifetime chromium exposure dose via drinking water, calculated from the results of the water analyses and the questionnaire data, showed associations with blood and hair chromium levels and certain hematological and biochemical parameters. Groups of subjects whose hematological or biochemical parameters were outside the normal range were not correlated with chromium exposure dose, except for groups of subjects with high triglycerides or low sodium. Motor impairment score was not associated with exposure to chromium."
394,"Impact of a collaborative interprofessional learning experience upon medical and social work students in geriatric health care."
395,"Abstract Interprofessional collaborative practice is increasingly recognized as an essential model in health care. This study lends preliminary support to the notion that medical students (including residents) and social work students develop a broader understanding of one another's roles and contributions to enhancing community-dwelling geriatric patients' health, and develop a more thorough understanding of the inherent complexities and unique aspects of geriatric health care. Wilcoxon Signed Rank Tests of participants' scores on the Index of Interdisciplinary Collaboration (IIC) indicated the training made significant changes to the students' perception of interprofessional collaboration. Qualitative analysis of participants' statements illustrated (1) benefits of the IPE experience, including complementary roles in holistic interventions; and (2) challenges to collaboration. The findings suggest that interprofessional educational experiences have a positive impact upon students' learning and strategies for enhanced care of geriatric patients."
396,"Effects of Home-Based Interval Walking Training on Thigh Muscle Strength and Aerobic Capacity in Female Total Hip Arthroplasty Patients: A Randomized, Controlled Pilot Study."
397,"Due to the reduced physical activity of patients who have undergone total hip arthroplasty (THA), there are no home-based exercise training regimens for preventing muscle atrophy and aerobic capacity impairment in these patients. We examined whether interval walking training (IWT) could prevented these issues. Twenty-eight female patients ( approximately 60 years of age) who had undergone THA more than 2 months prior were randomly divided into IWT (n = 14) and control (CNT, n = 14) groups. The IWT subjects trained at a target of 60 min of fast walking at >70% peak aerobic capacity for walking ([Formula: see text]O2peak) per wk for 12 wk, while those in the CNT maintained their previous sedentary life during the same period. We measured the energy expenditure of the daily physical activity, except during sleeping and bathing, every minute and every day during the intervention. We also measured the isometric knee extension (FEXT) and flexion (FFLX) forces, [Formula: see text]O2peak, and anaerobic threshold during the graded cycling exercise ([Formula: see text]O2AT) before and after the intervention. All subjects, except for one in IWT, completed the protocol. FFLX increased by 23% on the operated side (P = 0.003) and 14% on the non-operated side of IWT (P = 0.006), while it only increased on the operated side of CNT (P = 0.03). The [Formula: see text]O2peak and [Formula: see text]O2AT in IWT increased by 8% (P = 0.08) and 13% (P = 0.002), respectively, and these changes were significantly higher in the IWT than in CNT group (both, P<0.05). In conclusion, IWT might be an effective home-based training regimen for preventing the muscle atrophy from reduced daily physical activity in THA patients.

398,"Nanoblinker: Brownian Motion Powered Bio-Nanomachine for FRET Detection of Phagocytic Phase of Apoptosis."
399,"We describe a new type of bio-nanomachine which runs on thermal noise. The machine is solely powered by the random motion of water molecules in its environment and does not ever require re-fuelling. The construct, which is made of DNA and vaccinia virus topoisomerase protein, can detect DNA damage by employing fluorescence. It uses Brownian motion as a cyclic motor to continually separate and bring together two types of fluorescent hairpins participating in FRET. This bio-molecular oscillator is a fast and specific sensor of 5'OH double-strand DNA breaks present in phagocytic phase of apoptosis. The detection takes 30 s in solution and 3 min in cell suspensions. The phagocytic phase is critical for the effective execution of apoptosis as it ensures complete degradation of the dying cells' DNA, preventing release of pathological, viral and tumor DNA and self-immunization. The construct can be used as a smart FRET probe in studies of cell death and phagocytosis."
400,"TGF-Beta Downregulation of Distinct Chloride Channels in Cystic Fibrosis-Affected Epithelia."
401,"RATIONALE: The cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) and Calcium-activated Chloride Conductance (CaCC) each play critical roles in maintaining normal hydration of epithelial surfaces including the airways and colon. TGF-beta is a genetic modifier of cystic fibrosis (CF), but how it influences the CF phenotype is not understood. OBJECTIVES: We tested the hypothesis that TGF-beta potently downregulates chloride-channel function and expression in two CF-affected epithelia (T84 colonocytes and primary human airway epithelia) compared with proteins known to be regulated by TGF-beta. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: TGF-beta reduced CaCC and CFTR-dependent chloride currents in both epithelia accompanied by reduced levels of TMEM16A and CFTR protein and transcripts. TGF-beta treatment disrupted normal regulation of airway-surface liquid volume in polarized primary human airway epithelia, and reversed F508del CFTR correction produced by VX-809. TGF-beta effects on the expression and activity of TMEM16A, wtCFTR and corrected F508del CFTR were seen at 10-fold lower concentrations relative to TGF-beta effects on e-cadherin (epithelial marker) and vimentin (mesenchymal marker) expression. TGF-beta downregulation of TMEM16A and CFTR expression were partially reversed by Smad3 and p38 MAPK inhibition, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: TGF-beta is sufficient to downregulate two critical chloride transporters in two CF-affected tissues that precedes expression changes of two distinct TGF-beta regulated proteins. Our results provide a plausible mechanism for CF-disease modification by TGF-beta through effects on CaCC."
402,"Association between Blood Lipid Levels and Personality Traits in Young Korean Women."
403,"Abnormal lipid levels are important etiological factors associated with the development of atherosclerosis and with increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Lipid levels are also influenced by lifestyle and behavioral factors, which suggests that personality traits might be related to abnormal lipid profiles. Studies on personality traits and lipid levels are relatively scarce in Korea. Therefore, the objective of this study was to examine the association between lipid levels and personality traits in young Korean women. A total of 1,701 young Korean women [mean age = 24.9+/-4.6 years (range 17-39)] who volunteered for personality trait evaluation were recruited for this study. Lipid levels, including total cholesterol, high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, and triglyceride, were measured in all subjects after an overnight fast, and a low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol level was calculated. The study population was divided into abnormal and normal lipid level groups according to the clinical criteria. Personality traits were measured using the Revised NEO Personality Inventory for the Five-Factor Model of personality. High neuroticism was associated with low HDL cholesterol levels. Low extraversion and openness were associated with high levels of triglyceride. At the facet level, the association between personality and lipid levels were generally consistent. Angry hostility, self-consciousness, vulnerability to stress, activity, and straightforwardness were associated with HDL cholesterol levels. Activity, positive emotion, aesthetics, actions, and deliberation were associated with triglyceride. When applying clinical criteria, conscientiousness was less likely to have abnormal total cholesterol levels. Our results showed that the women with the low HDL cholesterol levels are like to be more neurotic and the hyperglycemic women are prone to lower extraversion and openness in Korea. Understanding the associations between blood lipid levels and personality traits may have a beneficial effect for the managing of dyslipidemia."
404,"Lytic phages obscure the cost of antibiotic resistance in Escherichia coli."
405,"The long-term persistence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria depends on their fitness relative to other genotypes in the absence of drugs. Outside the laboratory, viruses that parasitize bacteria (phages) are ubiquitous, but costs of antibiotic resistance are typically studied in phage-free experimental conditions. We used a mathematical model and experiments with Escherichia coli to show that lytic phages strongly affect the incidence of antibiotic resistance in drug-free conditions. Under phage parasitism, the likelihood that antibiotic-resistant genetic backgrounds spread depends on their initial frequency, mutation rate and intrinsic growth rate relative to drug-susceptible genotypes, because these parameters determine relative rates of phage-resistance evolution on different genetic backgrounds. Moreover, the average cost of antibiotic resistance in terms of intrinsic growth in the antibiotic-free experimental environment was small relative to the benefits of an increased mutation rate in the presence of phages. This is consistent with our theoretical work indicating that, under phage selection, typical costs of antibiotic resistance can be outweighed by realistic increases in mutability if drug resistance and hypermutability are genetically linked, as is frequently observed in clinical isolates. This suggests the long-term distribution of antibiotic resistance depends on the relative rates at which different lineages adapt to other types of selection, which in the case of phage parasitism is probably extremely common, as well as costs of resistance inferred by classical in vitro methods.The ISME Journal advance online publication, 30 September 2014; doi:10.1038/ismej.2014.176."
406,"The Inner Foreskin of Healthy Males at Risk of HIV Infection Harbors Epithelial CD4+ CCR5+ Cells and Has Features of an Inflamed Epidermal Barrier."
407,"Male circumcision provides partial protection against multiple sexually transmitted infections (STIs), including HIV, but the mechanisms are not fully understood. To examine potential vulnerabilities in foreskin epithelial structure, we used Wilcoxon paired tests adjusted using the false discovery rate method to compare inner and outer foreskin samples from 20 healthy, sexually active Peruvian males who have sex with males or transgender females, ages 21-29, at elevated risk of HIV infection. No evidence of epithelial microtrauma was identified, as assessed by keratinocyte activation, fibronectin deposition, or parakeratosis. However, multiple suprabasal tight junction differences were identified: 1) inner foreskin stratum corneum was thinner than outer (p = 0.035); 2) claudin 1 had extended membrane-bound localization throughout inner epidermis stratum spinosum (p = 0.035); 3) membrane-bound claudin 4 was absent from inner foreskin stratum granulosum (p = 0.035); and 4) occludin had increased membrane deposition in inner foreskin stratum granulosum (p = 0.042) versus outer. Together, this suggests subclinical inflammation and paracellular transport modifications to the inner foreskin. A setting of inflammation was further supported by inner foreskin epithelial explant cultures secreting higher levels of GM-CSF (p = 0.029), IP-10 (p = 0.035) and RANTES (p = 0.022) than outer foreskin, and also containing an increased density of CCR5+ and CD4+ CCR5+ cells (p = 0.022). Inner foreskin dermis also secreted more RANTES than outer (p = 0.036), and had increased density of CCR5+ cells (p = 0.022). In conclusion, subclinical changes to the inner foreskin of sexually active males may support an inflammatory state, with availability of target cells for HIV infection and modifications to epidermal barriers, potentially explaining the benefits of circumcision for STI prevention."
408,"Prostate Tumor-Derived Exosomes Down-Regulate NKG2D Expression on Natural Killer Cells and CD8+ T Cells: Mechanism of Immune Evasion."
409,"Tumor-derived exosomes, which are nanometer-sized extracellular vesicles of endosomal origin, have emerged as promoters of tumor immune evasion but their role in prostate cancer (PC) progression is poorly understood. In this study, we investigated the ability of prostate tumor-derived exosomes to downregulate NKG2D expression on natural killer (NK) and CD8+ T cells. NKG2D is an activating cytotoxicity receptor whose aberrant loss in cancer plays an important role in immune suppression. Using flow cytometry, we found that exosomes produced by human PC cells express ligands for NKG2D on their surface. The NKG2D ligand-expressing prostate tumor-derived exosomes selectively induced downregulation of NKG2D on NK and CD8+ T cells in a dose-dependent manner, leading to impaired cytotoxic function in vitro. Consistent with these findings, patients with castration-resistant PC (CRPC) showed a significant decrease in surface NKG2D expression on circulating NK and CD8+ T cells compared to healthy individuals. Tumor-derived exosomes are likely involved in this NKG2D downregulation, since incubation of healthy lymphocytes with exosomes isolated from serum or plasma of CRPC patients triggered downregulation of NKG2D expression in effector lymphocytes. These data suggest prostate tumor-derived exosomes as down-regulators of the NKG2D-mediated cytotoxic response in PC patients, thus promoting immune suppression and tumor escape."
410,"Exploring the Human Mesenchymal Stem Cell Tubule Communication Network through Electron Microscopy."
411,"Abstract Cells use several mechanisms to transfer information to other cells. In this study, we describe micro/nanotubular connections and exosome-like tubule fragments in multipotent mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) from human arteries. Scanning and transmission electron microscopy allowed characterization of sinusoidal microtubular projections (700 nm average size, 200 microm average length, with bulging mitochondria and actin microfilaments); short, uniform, variously shaped nanotubular projections (100 nm, bidirectional communication); and tubule fragments (50 nm). This is the first study demonstrating that MSCs from human arteries constitutively interact through an articulate and dynamic tubule network allowing long-range cell to cell communication."
412,"Clinical Management of Staphylococcus aureus Bacteremia: A Review."
413,"Importance: Several management strategies may improve outcomes in patients with Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia. Objectives: To review evidence of management strategies for S aureus bacteremia to determine whether transesophageal echocardiography is necessary in all adult cases and what is the optimal antibiotic therapy for methicillin-resistant S aureus (MRSA) bacteremia. Evidence Review: A PubMed search from inception through May 2014 was performed to identify studies addressing the role of transesophageal echocardiography in S aureus bacteremia. A second search of PubMed, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library from January 1990 through May 2014 was performed to find studies addressing antibiotic treatment for MRSA bacteremia. Studies reporting outcomes from antibiotic therapy for MRSA bacteremia were included. All searches, which were limited to English and focused on adults, were augmented by review of bibliographic references from included studies. The quality of evidence was assessed using the Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation system with consensus of independent evaluations by at least 2 of the authors. Findings: In 9 studies with a total of 4050 patients, use of transesophageal echocardiography was associated with higher rates of a diagnosis of endocarditis (14%-28%) compared with transthoracic echocardiography (2%-15%). In 4 studies, clinical or transthoracic echocardiography findings did not predict subsequent transesophageal echocardiography findings of endocarditis. Five studies identified clinical or transthoracic echocardiography characteristics associated with low risk of endocarditis (negative predictive values from 93% to 100%). Characteristics associated with a low risk of endocarditis include absence of a permanent intracardiac device, sterile follow-up blood cultures within 4 days after the initial set, no hemodialysis dependence, nosocomial acquisition of S aureus bacteremia, absence of secondary foci of infection, and no clinical signs of infective endocarditis. Of 81 studies of antibiotic therapy for MRSA bacteremia, only 1 high-quality trial was identified. In that study of 246 patients with S aureus bacteremia, daptomycin was not inferior to vancomycin or an antistaphylococcal penicillin, each in combination with low-dose, short-course gentamicin (clinical success rate, 44.2% [53/120] vs 41.7% [48/115]; absolute difference, 2.4% [95% CI, -10.2% to 15.1%]). Conclusions and Relevance: All adult patients with S aureus bacteremia should undergo echocardiography. Characteristics of low-risk patients with S aureus bacteremia for whom transesophageal echocardiography can be safely avoided have been identified. Vancomycin and daptomycin are the first-line antibiotic choices for MRSA bacteremia. Well-designed studies to address the management of S aureus bacteremia are needed."
414,"Survival and Long-term Outcomes Following Bioprosthetic vs Mechanical Aortic Valve Replacement in Patients Aged 50 to 69 Years."
415,"Importance: The choice between bioprosthetic and mechanical aortic valve replacement in younger patients is controversial because long-term survival and major morbidity are poorly characterized. Objective: To quantify survival and major morbidity in patients aged 50 to 69 years undergoing aortic valve replacement. Design, Setting, and Participants: Retrospective cohort analysis of 4253 patients aged 50 to 69 years who underwent primary isolated aortic valve replacement using bioprosthetic vs mechanical valves in New York State from 1997 through 2004, identified using the Statewide Planning and Research Cooperative System. Median follow-up time was 10.8 years (range, 0 to 16.9 years); the last follow-up date for mortality was November 30, 2013. Propensity matching yielded 1001 patient pairs. Main Outcomes and Measures: Primary outcome was all-cause mortality; secondary outcomes were stroke, reoperation, and major bleeding. Results: No differences in survival or stroke rates were observed in patients with bioprosthetic compared with mechanical valves. Actuarial 15-year survival was 60.6% (95% CI, 56.3%-64.9%) in the bioprosthesis group compared with 62.1% (95% CI, 58.2%-66.0%) in the mechanical prosthesis group (hazard ratio, 0.97 [95% CI, 0.83-1.14]). The 15-year cumulative incidence of stroke was 7.7% (95% CI, 5.7%-9.7%) in the bioprosthesis group and 8.6% (95% CI, 6.2%-11.0%) in the mechanical prosthesis group (hazard ratio, 1.04 [95% CI, 0.75-1.43). The 15-year cumulative incidence of reoperation was higher in the bioprosthesis group (12.1% [95% CI, 8.8%-15.4%] vs 6.9% [95% CI, 4.2%-9.6%]; hazard ratio, 0.52 [95% CI, 0.36-0.75]). The 15-year cumulative incidence of major bleeding was higher in the mechanical prosthesis group (13.0% [95% CI, 9.9%-16.1%] vs 6.6% [95% CI, 4.8%-8.4%]; hazard ratio, 1.75 [95% CI, 1.27-2.43]). The 30-day mortality rate was 18.7% after stroke, 9.0% after reoperation, and 13.2% after major bleeding. Conclusions and Relevance: Among propensity-matched patients aged 50 to 69 years who underwent aortic valve replacement with bioprosthetic compared with mechanical valves, there was no significant difference in 15-year survival or stroke. Patients in the bioprosthetic valve group had a greater likelihood of reoperation but a lower likelihood of major bleeding. These findings suggest that bioprosthetic valves may be a reasonable choice in patients aged 50 to 69 years."
416,"Acupuncture for Chronic Knee Pain: A Randomized Clinical Trial."
417,"Importance: There is debate about benefits of acupuncture for knee pain. Objective: To determine the efficacy of laser and needle acupuncture for chronic knee pain. Design, Setting, and Participants: Zelen-design clinical trial (randomization occurred before informed consent), in Victoria, Australia (February 2010-December 2012). Community volunteers (282 patients aged >/=50 years with chronic knee pain) were treated by family physician acupuncturists. Interventions: No acupuncture (control group, n = 71) and needle (n = 70), laser (n = 71), and sham laser (n = 70) acupuncture. Treatments were delivered for 12 weeks. Participants and acupuncturists were blinded to laser and sham laser acupuncture. Control participants were unaware of the trial. Main Outcomes and Measures: Primary outcomes were average knee pain (numeric rating scale, 0 [no pain] to 10 [worst pain possible]; minimal clinically important difference [MCID], 1.8 units) and physical function (Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index, 0 [no difficulty] to 68 [extreme difficulty]; MCID, 6 units) at 12 weeks. Secondary outcomes included other pain and function measures, quality of life, global change, and 1-year follow-up. Analyses were by intention-to-treat using multiple imputation for missing outcome data. Results: At 12 weeks and 1 year, 26 (9%) and 50 (18%) participants were lost to follow-up, respectively. Analyses showed neither needle nor laser acupuncture significantly improved pain (mean difference; -0.4 units; 95% CI, -1.2 to 0.4, and -0.1; 95% CI, -0.9 to 0.7, respectively) or function (-1.7; 95% CI, -6.1 to 2.6, and 0.5; 95% CI, -3.4 to 4.4, respectively) compared with sham at 12 weeks. Compared with control, needle and laser acupuncture resulted in modest improvements in pain (-1.1; 95% CI, -1.8 to -0.4, and -0.8; 95% CI, -1.5 to -0.1, respectively) at 12 weeks, but not at 1 year. Needle acupuncture resulted in modest improvement in function compared with control at 12 weeks (-3.9; 95% CI, -7.7 to -0.2) but was not significantly different from sham (-1.7; 95% CI, -6.1 to 2.6) and was not maintained at 1 year. There were no differences for most secondary outcomes and no serious adverse events. Conclusions and Relevance: In patients older than 50 years with moderate or severe chronic knee pain, neither laser nor needle acupuncture conferred benefit over sham for pain or function. Our findings do not support acupuncture for these patients. Trial Registration: anzctr.org.au Identifier: ACTRN12609001001280."
418,"Effect of a Postdischarge Virtual Ward on Readmission or Death for High-Risk Patients: A Randomized Clinical Trial."
419,"Importance: Hospital readmissions are common and costly, and no single intervention or bundle of interventions has reliably reduced readmissions. Virtual wards, which use elements of hospital care in the community, have the potential to reduce readmissions, but have not yet been rigorously evaluated. Objective: To determine whether a virtual ward-a model of care that uses some of the systems of a hospital ward to provide interprofessional care for community-dwelling patients-can reduce the risk of readmission in patients at high risk of readmission or death when being discharged from hospital. Design, Setting, and Patients: High-risk adult hospital discharge patients in Toronto were randomly assigned to either the virtual ward or usual care. A total of 1923 patients were randomized during the course of the study: 960 to the usual care group and 963 to the virtual ward group. The first patient was enrolled on June 29, 2010, and follow-up was completed on June 2, 2014. Interventions: Patients assigned to the virtual ward received care coordination plus direct care provision (via a combination of telephone, home visits, or clinic visits) from an interprofessional team for several weeks after hospital discharge. The interprofessional team met daily at a central site to design and implement individualized management plans. Patients assigned to usual care typically received a typed, structured discharge summary, prescription for new medications if indicated, counseling from the resident physician, arrangements for home care as needed, and recommendations, appointments, or both for follow-up care with physicians as indicated. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was a composite of hospital readmission or death within 30 days of discharge. Secondary outcomes included nursing home admission and emergency department visits, each of the components of the primary outcome at 30 days, as well as each of the outcomes (including the composite primary outcome) at 90 days, 6 months, and 1 year. Results: There were no statistically significant between-group differences in the primary or secondary outcomes at 30 or 90 days, 6 months, or 1 year. The primary outcome occurred in 203 of 959 (21.2%) of the virtual ward patients and 235 of 956 (24.6%) of the usual care patients (absolute difference, 3.4%; 95% CI, -0.3% to 7.2%; P = .09). There were no statistically significant interactions to indicate that the virtual ward model of care was more or less effective in any of the prespecified subgroups. Conclusions and Relevance: In a diverse group of high-risk patients being discharged from the hospital, we found no statistically significant effect of a virtual ward model of care on readmissions or death at either 30 days or 90 days, 6 months, or 1 year after hospital discharge.

420,"Riociguat as a treatment regime for pulmonary arterial hypertension: a review."
421,"Abstract Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) and chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH) is a life-threatening condition distinguished by elevated pressure of pulmonary arteries and increased vascular resistance. The management of patients with PAH and CTEPH has advanced rapidly over last decade but despite the progress in the treatment, the survival of suffering patients remain unsatisfactory and there is no cure for the diseases. However, surgery is not a first choice for patients. Furthermore, some patients who undergo surgery have persistent pulmonary hypertension (HTN) as a side effect after surgery. Therefore, the search for an ""ideal"" therapy still goes on and it lead to the approval of riociguat as a potential agent for the treatment. It acts directly on soluble guanylate cyclase, exciting the enzyme, and elevating sensitivity to lower levels of NO. Riociguat, therefore, has potential as a novel therapy for PAH and CTEPH. This review is focused on various aspects of the recently approved ""riociguat"" including its efficacy and safety profiles with the clinical data highlighting its importance in the present scenario."
422,"Effects of hormone therapy on blood pressure."
423,"OBJECTIVE: Although hormone therapy remains the most efficacious option for the management of vasomotor symptoms of menopause, its effects on blood pressure remain unclear. This review scrutinizes evidence of the mechanisms of action of hormone therapy on signaling pathways affecting blood pressure and evidence from clinical studies. METHODS: Comprehensive Ovid MEDLINE searches were conducted for the terms ""hypertension"" and either of the following ""hormone therapy and menopause"" or ""selective estrogen receptor modulator"" from year 2000 to November 2013. RESULTS: In vitro and physiologic studies did not reveal a clear deleterious effect of hormone therapy on blood pressure. The effect of oral therapy was essentially neutral in large trials conducted in normotensive women with blood pressure as primary outcome. Results from all other trials had several limitations. Oral therapy had a neutral effect on blood pressure in hypertensive women. Transdermal estrogen and micronized progesterone had a beneficial effect on blood pressure in normotensive women and, at most, a neutral effect on hypertensive women. In general, tibolone and raloxifene had a neutral effect on blood pressure in both hypertensive and normotensive women. CONCLUSIONS: Large randomized trials are needed to assess the effect of oral hormone therapy on blood pressure as a primary outcome in hypertensive women and the effect of transdermal preparations on both normotensive and hypertensive women. Transdermal preparations would be the preferred mode of therapy for hypertensive women, in view of their favorable physiologic and clinical profiles. The decision regarding the use of hormone therapy should be individualized, and blood pressure should be monitored during the course of treatment."
424,"Human T follicular helper cells in primary immunodeficiencies."
425,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To summarize our understanding of the biology of T follicular helper (Tfh) cells and how insights into this are being provided by the study of human monogenic immunological diseases. RECENT FINDINGS: Antibody production is a key feature of the vertebrate immune system. Antibodies neutralize and clear pathogens, thereby protecting against infectious diseases. Long-lived humoral immunity depends on help provided by Tfh cells, which support the differentiation of antigen-specific B cells into memory and plasma cells. Tfh cells are generated from naive CD4 T cells following the receipt of inputs from various cell surface receptors. Although genetically modified mice have provided a great understanding of the requirements for generating Tfh cells, it is critical that the requirements for human Tfh cells are also established. This is being achieved by the systematic analysis of humans with monogenic mutations that cause primary immunodeficiencies characterized by impaired humoral immunity following infection or vaccination. SUMMARY: The elucidation of the mechanisms that regulate Tfh cell generation, differentiation and function should reveal targets for novel therapeutics that may offer opportunities to manipulate these cells to not only improve humoral immunity in the setting of primary immunodeficiencies but also temper their dysregulation in conditions of antibody-mediated autoimmunity."
426,"Multiple intestinal atresia with combined immune deficiency."
427,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To update on the molecular and cellular basis of multiple intestinal atresia (MIA). RECENT FINDINGS: Mutations of the tetratricopeptide repeat domain 7A gene have been identified in patients with MIA and other related disorders, including MIA associated with combined immunodeficiency and very early onset inflammatory bowel disease with apoptotic enterocolitis. Pathological findings in patients with MIA and MIA associated with combined immunodeficiency include abnormalities of enterocyte apicobasal polarity, increased apoptosis of intestinal cells, decreased proliferation of intestinal crypts, and defects of thymic architecture associated with lymphoid depletion. Dysregulated RhoA signaling and defective expression of phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase IIIalpha represent biochemical cellular hallmarks of the disease. SUMMARY: The study of patients with MIA and related disorders has established that tetratricopeptide repeat domain 7A plays a critical role in intestinal and immune homeostasis. Identification of biochemical defects may pave the way to novel pharmacological interventions for this group of severe congenital disorders."
428,"Anesthesia Residents' Global (Departmental) Evaluation of Faculty Anesthesiologists' Supervision Can Be Less Than Their Average Evaluations of Individual Anesthesiologists."
429,"BACKGROUND:: Faculty anesthesiologists' supervision of anesthesiology residents is required for both postgraduate medical education and billing compliance. Previously, using the de Oliveira Filho et al. supervision question set, De Oliveira et al. found that residents who reported mean department-wide supervision scores <3.0 (""frequent"") reported a significantly more frequent occurrence of mistakes with negative consequences to patients, as well as medication errors. In our department, residents provide daily evaluations of the supervision received by individual faculty. Using a survey study, we compared relationships between residents' daily supervision scores for individual faculty anesthesiologists and residents' supervision scores for the entire department (comprised these faculty). METHODS:: We studied all anesthesiology residents in clinical years 1, 2, and 3 (i.e., neither in the ""base year"" nor in fellowship). There were daily evaluations of individual faculty supervision of operative anesthesia for 36 weeks. Residents clicked a hyperlink on the invitation e-mail taking them to a secure Web page to provide their global (departmental) assessment of faculty supervision. We calculated the ratio of each resident's global (departmental) faculty supervision score (i.e., mean among 9 questions x 1 evaluation) to the same resident's daily evaluations of individual faculty (i.e., mean among 9 questions x many evaluations). RESULTS:: All 39 of 39 residents chose to participate. The mean departmental supervision score was significantly less (P < 0.0001) than the mean of individual faculty scores. The median ratio of scores was 86% (95% confidence interval, 83%-89%). Kendall's rank correlation between global and (mean) individual faculty scores was taub = 0.34 +/- 0.11 (P = 0.0032). The ratios were uniformly distributed (P = 0.64) between the observed minimums and maximums; were not correlated with the mean value of individual faculty scores previously provided by each resident (P = 0.64); were not correlated with the number of individual faculty evaluations previously provided by each resident (P = 0.49); and did not differ among the first, second, or third year residents (P = 0.37). CONCLUSIONS:: Residents' perceptions of overall (departmental) faculty supervision were less than overall averages of their perceptions of individual faculty supervision. This should be considered when interpreting national survey results (e.g., of patient safety), residency program evaluations, and individual faculty anesthesiologist performance."
430,"Malignant Hyperthermia Deaths Related to Inadequate Temperature Monitoring, 2007-2012: A Report from The North American Malignant Hyperthermia Registry of the Malignant Hyperthermia Association of the United States."
431,"BACKGROUND:: AMRA (adverse metabolic or muscular reaction to anesthesia) reports submitted to The North American Malignant Hyperthermia Registry of the Malignant Hyperthermia Association of the United States from 1987 to 2006 revealed a 2.7% cardiac arrest and a 1.4% death rate for 291 malignant hyperthermia (MH) events. We analyzed 6 years of recent data to update MH cardiac arrest and death rates, summarized characteristics associated with cardiac arrest and death, and documented differences between early and recent cohorts of patients in the MH Registry. We also tested whether the available data supported the hypothesis that risk of dying from an episode of MH is increased in patients with inadequate temperature monitoring. METHODS:: We included U.S. or Canadian reports of adverse events after administration of at least 1 anesthetic drug, received between January 1, 2007, and December 31, 2012, with an MH clinical grading scale rank of ""very likely MH"" or ""almost certain MH."" We excluded reports that, after review, were judged to be due to pathologic conditions other than MH. We analyzed patient demographics, family and patient anesthetic history, anesthetic management including temperature monitoring, initial dantrolene dose, use of cardiopulmonary resuscitation, MH complications, survival, and reported molecular genetic DNA analysis of RYR1 and CACNA1S. A one-sided Cochran-Armitage test for proportions evaluated associations between mode of monitoring and mortality. We used Miettinen and Nurminen's method for assessing the relative risk of dying according to monitoring method. We used the P value of the slope to evaluate the relationship between duration of anesthetic exposure before dantrolene administration and peak temperature. We calculated the relative risk of death in this cohort compared with our previous cohort by using the Miettinen and Nurminen method adjusted for 4 comparisons. RESULTS:: Of 189 AMRA reports, 84 met our inclusion criteria. These included 7 (8.3%) cardiac arrests, no successful resuscitations, and 8 (9.5%) deaths. Of the 8 patients who died, 7 underwent elective surgeries considered low to intermediate risk. The average age of patients who died was 31.4 +/- 16.9 years. Five were healthy preoperatively. Three of the 8 patients had unrevealed MH family history. Four of 8 anesthetics were performed in freestanding facilities. In those who died, 3 MH-causative RYR1 mutations and 3 RYR1 variants likely to have been pathogenic were found in the 6 patients in whom RYR1 was examined. Compared to core temperature monitoring, the relative risk of dying with no temperature monitoring was 13.8 (lower limit 2.1). Compared to core temperature monitoring, the relative risk of dying with skin temperature monitoring was 9.7 (1.5). Temperature monitoring mode best distinguished patients who lived from those who died. End-tidal CO2 was the worst physiologic measure to distinguish patients who lived from those who died. Longer anesthetic exposures before dantrolene were associated with higher peak temperatures (P = 0.00056). Compared with the early cohort, the recent cohort had a higher percentage of MH deaths (4/291 vs 8/84; relative risk = 6.9; 95% confidence interval, 1.7-28; P = 0.0043 after adjustment for 4 comparisons). CONCLUSIONS:: Despite a thorough understanding of the management of MH and the availability of a specific antidote, the risk of dying from an MH episode remains unacceptably high. To increase the chance of successful MH treatment, the American Society of Anesthesiologists and Malignant Hyperthermia Association of the U.S. monitoring standards should be altered to require core temperature monitoring for all general anesthetics lasting 30 minutes or longer."
432,"The Hepatic Expression of Vitamin D Receptor is Inversely Associated with the Severity of Liver Damage in Genotype 1 Chronic Hepatitis C Patients."
433,"Background/aims: Low 25-Hydroxyvitamin D serum levels have been associated with the severity of liver fibrosis in genotype 1 chronic hepatitis C patients (G1CHC), and experimental evidence suggested a hepatoprotective role of vitamin D via interaction with hepatic vitamin D receptor (VDR). We assessed the hepatic expression of VDR protein and its association with liver disease severity. Methods: Ninety-one consecutive patients with biopsy-proven G1CHC and available frozen liver tissue were evaluated. Ten subjects without chronic liver diseases and nine patients with autoimmune hepatitis served as controls. The hepatic expression of VDR protein was assessed by western blot for quantification, and by immunohistochemistry for morphological distribution. Results: Liver VDR protein was mainly localized in hepatocytes and cholangiocytes, and its expression by western blot was similar in CHC and controls (1.83+/-0.97 vs. 2.18+/-0.62, p=0.14), but lower in autoimmune hepatitis (0.84+/-0.14, p<0.001). The expression was lower in CHC with severe necroinflammatory activity (1.44+/-0.87) vs. both controls and CHC with grade 1-2 inflammation (1.94+/-0.97)(p=0.01 and p=0.03, respectively), but higher compared to autoimmune hepatitis (p=0.007). A similar difference was observed in CHC patients with F3-F4 fibrosis, whose VDR expression (1.51+/-1.07) was also lower compared with controls and CHC with F0-F2 fibrosis (1.98+/-0.89)(p=0.02 and p=0.04, respectively), but higher vs. autoimmune hepatitis (p=0.003). At multivariate logistic regression analysis, low VDR protein expression remained associated with severe necroinflammatory activity and severe fibrosis (OR 0.543,95%CI, 0.288-0.989, p=0.04; and OR 0.484,95%CI 0.268-0.877, p=0.01, respectively) in CHC after correction for clinical, biochemical and histological features. Conclusion: In a cohort of G1CHC patients, the hepatic expression of VDR protein is associated with the severity of both liver fibrosis and inflammation."
434,"In older men, higher plasma testosterone or dihydrotestosterone are independent predictors for reduced incidence of stroke but not myocardial infarction."
435,"Context: Older men have lower testosterone (T) levels but whether differences in circulating T, or its metabolites dihydrotestosterone (DHT) or estradiol (E2) contribute to cardiovascular disease remains controversial. Objective: We tested the hypothesis that plasma T, DHT and E2 are differentially associated with incidence of myocardial infarction (MI) and stroke in older men. Participants and methods: Plasma total T, DHT and E2 were assayed using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry in early morning samples from 3,690 community-dwelling men aged 70-89 years. Outcomes of first hospital admission or death due to MI or stroke were ascertained by data linkage. Results: Mean follow-up was 6.6 years. Incident MI occurred in 344, stroke in 300 and neither in 3,046 men. In multivariate analysis adjusting for age and other risk factors, neither T, DHT nor E2 were associated with incident MI (fully-adjusted hazard ratio [HR] for T in Quartile (Q)4 vs Q1: 0.92, 95% confidence interval [CI]=0.66-1.28; DHT: 0.83, 0.59-1.15; E2: 0.84, 0.62-1.15). Higher T or DHT was associated with lower incidence of stroke (T: Q4:Q1 fully-adjusted HR=0.56, 95% CI=0.39-0.81, p=0.002; DHT: 0.57, 0.40-0.81, p=0.002). E2 was not associated with stroke (HR=0.76, 95% CI=0.54-1.08, p=0.123). Conclusions: Higher plasma T or DHT are biomarkers for reduced risk of stroke but not MI. Androgen exposure may influence outcomes following rather than incidence of MI, while androgens but not E2 are independent predictors of stroke risk. Randomised clinical trials are needed to clarify the impact of modifying T or DHT on the risk of stroke in ageing men."
436,"Effect of Spinal Cord Compression on Local Vascular Blood Flow and Perfusion Capacity."
437,"Spinal cord injury (SCI) can induce prolonged spinal cord compression that may result in a reduction of local tissue perfusion, progressive ischemia, and potentially irreversible tissue necrosis. Due to the combination of risk factors and the varied presentation of symptoms, the appropriate method and time course for clinical intervention following SCI are not always evident. In this study, a three-dimensional finite element fluid-structure interaction model of the cervical spinal cord was developed to examine how traditionally sub-clinical compressive mechanical loads impact spinal arterial blood flow. The spinal cord and surrounding dura mater were modeled as linear elastic, isotropic, and incompressible solids, while blood was modeled as a single-phased, incompressible Newtonian fluid. Simulation results indicate that anterior, posterior, and anteroposterior compressions of the cervical spinal cord have significantly different ischemic potentials, with prediction that the posterior component of loading elevates patient risk due to the concomitant reduction of blood flow in the arterial branches. Conversely, anterior loading compromises flow through the anterior spinal artery but minimally impacts branch flow rates. The findings of this study provide novel insight into how sub-clinical spinal cord compression could give rise to certain disease states, and suggest a need to monitor spinal artery perfusion following even mild compressive loading."
438,"High Local Diversity of Trypanosoma in a Common Bat Species, and Implications for the Biogeography and Taxonomy of the T. cruzi Clade."
439,"The Trypanosoma cruzi clade is a group of parasites that comprises T. cruzi sensu lato and its closest relatives. Although several species have been confirmed phylogenetically to belong to this clade, it is uncertain how many more species can be expected to belong into this group. Here, we present the results of a survey of trypanosome parasites of the bat Artibeus jamaicensis from the Panama Canal Zone, an important seed disperser. Using a genealogical species delimitation approach, the Poisson tree processes (PTP), we tentatively identified five species of trypanosomes - all belonging to the T. cruzi clade. A small monophyletic group of three putative Trypanosoma species places at the base of the clade phylogeny, providing evidence for at least five independent colonization events of these parasites into the New World. Artibeus jamaicensis presents a high diversity of these blood parasites and is the vertebrate with the highest number of putative trypanosome species reported from a single locality. Our results emphasize the need for continued efforts to survey mammalian trypanosomes."
440,"SERPINE1 and SMA expression at the invasive front predict extracapsular spread and survival in oral squamous cell carcinoma."
441,"Background:Extracapsular spread (ECS) in cervical lymph nodes is the single-most prognostic clinical variable in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC), but diagnosis is possible only after histopathological examination. A promising biomarker in the primary tumour, alpha smooth muscle actin (SMA) has been shown to be highly prognostic, however, validated biomarkers to predict ECS prior to primary treatment are not yet available.Methods:In 102 OSCC cases, conventional imaging was compared with pTNM staging. SERPINE1, identified from expression microarray of primary tumours as a potential biomarker for ECS, was validated through mRNA expression, and by immunohistochemistry (IHC) on a tissue microarray from the same cohort. Similarly, expression of SMA was also compared with its association with ECS and survival. Expression was analysed separately in the tumour centre and advancing front; and prognostic capability determined using Kaplan-Meier survival analysis.Results:Immunohistochemistry indicated that both SERPINE1 and SMA expression at the tumour-advancing front were significantly associated with ECS (P<0.001). ECS was associated with expression of either or both proteins in all cases. SMA+/SERPINE1+ expression in combination was highly significantly associated with poor survival (P<0.001). MRI showed poor sensitivity for detection of nodal metastasis (56%) and ECS (7%). Both separately, and in combination, SERPINE1 and SMA were superior to MRI for the detection of ECS (sensitivity: SERPINE1: 95%; SMA: 82%; combination: 81%).Conclusion:A combination of SMA and SERPINE1 IHC offer potential as prognostic biomarkers in OSCC. Our findings suggest that biomarkers at the invasive front are likely to be necessary in prediction of ECS or in therapeutic stratification.British Journal of Cancer advance online publication 30 September 2014; doi:10.1038/bjc.2014.500 www.bjcancer.com."
442,"Excess of miRNA-378a-5p perturbs mitotic fidelity and correlates with breast cancer tumourigenesis in vivo."
443,"Background:Optimal expression and proper function of key mitotic proteins facilitate control and repair processes that aim to prevent loss or gain of chromosomes, a hallmark of cancer. Altered expression of small regulatory microRNAs is associated with tumourigenesis and metastasis but the impact on mitotic signalling has remained unclear.Methods:Cell-based high-throughput screen identified miR-378a-5p as a mitosis perturbing microRNA. Transient transfections, immunofluorescence, western blotting, time-lapse microscopy, FISH and reporter assays were used to characterise the mitotic anomalies by excess miR-378a-5p. Analysis of microRNA profiles in breast tumours was performed.Results:Overexpression of miR-378a-5p induced numerical chromosome changes in cells and abrogated taxol-induced mitotic block via premature inactivation of the spindle assembly checkpoint. Moreover, excess miR-378a-5p triggered receptor tyrosine kinase-MAP kinase pathway signalling, and was associated with suppression of Aurora B kinase. In breast cancer in vivo, we found that high miR-378a-5p levels correlate with the most aggressive, poorly differentiated forms of cancer.Interpretation:Downregulation of Aurora B by excess miR-378a-5p can explain the observed microtubule drug resistance and increased chromosomal imbalance in the microRNA-overexpressing cells. The results suggest that breast tumours may deploy high miR-378a-5p levels to gain growth advantage and antagonise taxane therapy.British Journal of Cancer advance online publication, 30 September 2014; doi:10.1038/bjc.2014.524 www.bjcancer.com."
444,"A phase I trial of vertical inhibition of IGF signalling using cixutumumab, an anti-IGF-1R antibody, and selumetinib, an MEK 1/2 inhibitor, in advanced solid tumours."
445,"Background:We completed a phase I clinical trial to test the safety and toxicity of combined treatment with cixutumumab (anti-IGF-1R antibody) and selumetinib (MEK 1/2 inhibitor).Methods:Patients with advanced solid tumours, refractory to standard therapy received selumetinib hydrogen sulphate capsules orally twice daily, and cixutumumab intravenously on days 1 and 15 of each 28-day cycle. The study used a 3+3 design, with a dose-finding cohort followed by an expansion cohort at the maximally tolerated dose that included pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic correlative studies.Results:Thirty patients were enrolled, with 16 in the dose-finding cohort and 14 in the expansion cohort. Grade 3 or greater toxicities included nausea and vomiting, anaemia, CVA, hypertension, hyperglycaemia, and ophthalmic symptoms. The maximally tolerated combination dose was 50 mg twice daily of selumetinib and 12 mg kg-1 every 2 weeks of cixutumumab. Two patients achieved a partial response (one unconfirmed), including a patient with BRAF wild-type thyroid carcinoma, and a patient with squamous cell carcinoma of the tongue, and six patients achieved time to progression of >6 months, including patients with thyroid carcinoma, colorectal carcinoma, and basal cell carcinoma. Comparison of pre- and on-treatment biopsies showed significant suppression of pERK and pS6 activity with treatment.Conclusions:Our study of anti-IGF-1R antibody cixutumumab and MEK 1/2 inhibitor selumetinib showed that the combination is safe and well-tolerated at these doses, with preliminary evidence of clinical benefit and pharmacodynamic evidence of target inhibition.British Journal of Cancer advance online publication 30 September 2014; doi:10.1038/bjc.2014.515 www.bjcancer.com."
446,"Selecting first-line bevacizumab-containing therapy for advanced breast cancer: TURANDOT risk factor analyses."
447,"Background:The randomised phase III TURANDOT trial compared first-line bevacizumab-paclitaxel (BEV-PAC) vs bevacizumab-capecitabine (BEV-CAP) in HER2-negative locally recurrent/metastatic breast cancer (LR/mBC). The interim analysis revealed no difference in overall survival (OS; primary end point) between treatment arms; however, progression-free survival (PFS) and objective response rate were significantly superior with BEV-PAC. We sought to identify patient populations that may be most appropriately treated with one or other regimen.Methods:Patients with HER2-negative LR/mBC who had received no prior chemotherapy for advanced disease were randomised to either BEV-PAC (bevacizumab 10 mg kg-1 days 1 and 15 plus paclitaxel 90 mg m-2 days 1, 8 and 15 q4w) or BEV-CAP (bevacizumab 15 mg kg-1 day 1 plus capecitabine 1000 mg m-2 bid days 1-14 q3w). The study population was categorised into three cohorts: triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), high-risk hormone receptor-positive (HR+) and low-risk HR+. High- and low-risk HR+ were defined, respectively, as having 2 vs 1 of the following four risk factors: disease-free interval 24 months; visceral metastases; prior (neo)adjuvant anthracycline and/or taxane; and metastases in 3 organs.Results:The treatment effect on OS differed between cohorts. Non-significant OS trends favoured BEV-PAC in the TNBC cohort and BEV-CAP in the low-risk HR+ cohort. In all three cohorts, there was a non-significant PFS trend favouring BEV-PAC. Grade 3 adverse events were consistently less common with BEV-CAP.Conclusions:A simple risk factor index may help in selecting bevacizumab-containing regimens, balancing outcome, safety profile and patient preference. Final OS results are expected in 2015 (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00600340).British Journal of Cancer advance online publication, 30 September 2014; doi:10.1038/bjc.2014.504 www.bjcancer.com."
448,"The impact of low-grade toxicity in older people with cancer undergoing chemotherapy."
449,"Background:Significant toxicity in chemotherapy trials is usually defined as grade 3. In clinical practice, however, multiple lower grade toxicities are often considered meaningful. The purpose of this observational cohort study was to identify which level of toxicity triggers treatment modification and early discontinuation of chemotherapy in older people.Methods:Patients aged 65+ were recruited in a central London hospital. A total of 108 patients were recruited at the start of new chemotherapy treatment between October 2010 and July 2012.Results:Mean age was 72.1+/-5 years, median 72 and range 65-86 years. Of the patients, 50.9% (55) were male with gastrointestinal (49), gynaecological (18), lung (15) and other cancers (26). Chemotherapy was palliative in 59.3% (64/108), curative/ neoadjuvant/adjuvant in the others. Mean number of cycles completed was 4.2+/-3. Treatment modifications due to toxicity occurred in 60 (55.6%) patients, 35% (21/60) of whom had no greater than grade 2 toxicity. Early treatment discontinuation because of toxicity occurred in 23 patients (21.3%), 39.1% (9/23) of whom had no greater than grade 2 toxicity.Conclusions:Many older patients did not complete treatment as planned. Treatment was modified/discontinued even for one or two low-grade toxicities. Further work is required to clarify whether low-grade toxicity has a greater clinical impact in older people, or whether clinicians have a lower threshold for modifying/discontinuing treatment in older people.British Journal of Cancer advance online publication, 30 September 2014; doi:10.1038/bjc.2014.496 www.bjcancer.com."
450,"Efficacy of High Intensity Exercise on Disease Activity and Cardiovascular Risk in Active Axial Spondyloarthritis: A Randomized Controlled Pilot Study."
451,"BACKGROUND: Physical therapy is recommended for the management of axial spondyloarthritis (axSpA) and flexibility exercises have traditionally been the main focus. Cardiovascular (CV) diseases are considered as a major health concern in axSpA and there is strong evidence that endurance and strength exercise protects against CV diseases. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the efficacy of high intensity endurance and strength exercise on disease activity and CV health in patients with active axSpA. METHODS: In a single blinded randomized controlled pilot study the exercise group (EG) performed 12 weeks of endurance and strength exercise while the control group (CG) received treatment as usual. The primary outcome was the Ankylosing Spondylitis (AS) Disease Activity Score (ASDAS). Secondary outcomes included patient reported disease activity (Bath AS Disease Activity Index [BASDAI]), physical function (Bath AS Functional Index [BASFI]), and CV risk factors measured by arterial stiffness (Augmentation Index [Alx]) and Pulse Wave Velocity [PWV]), cardiorespiratory fitness (VO2 peak) and body composition. ANCOVA on the post intervention values with baseline values as covariates was used to assess group differences, and Mann Whitney U-test was used for outcomes with skewed residuals. RESULTS: Twenty-eight patients were included and 24 (EG, n = 10, CG, n = 14) completed the study. A mean treatment effect of -0.7 (95%CI: -1.4, 0.1) was seen in ASDAS score. Treatment effects were also observed in secondary outcomes (mean group difference [95%CI]): BASDAI: -2.0 (-3.6, -0.4), BASFI: -1.4 (-2.6, -0.3), arterial stiffness (estimated median group differences [95% CI]): AIx (%): -5.3 (-11.0, -0.5), and for PVW (m/s): -0.3 (-0.7, 0.0), VO2 peak (ml/kg/min) (mean group difference [95%CI]: 3.7 (2.1, 5.2) and trunk fat (%): -1.8 (-3.0, -0.6). No adverse events occurred. CONCLUSION: High intensity exercise improved disease activity and reduced CV risk factors in patients with active axSpA. These effects will be further explored in a larger trial. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01436942."
452,"Human Cytomegalovirus Tegument Protein pp65 Is Detected in All Intra- and Extra-Axial Brain Tumours Independent of the Tumour Type or Grade."
453,"Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) has been indicated being a significant oncomodulator. Recent reports have suggested that an antiviral treatment alters the outcome of a glioblastoma. We analysed the performance of commercial HCMV-antibodies applying the immunohistochemical (IHC) methods on brain sample obtained from a subject with a verified HCMV infection, on samples obtained from 14 control subjects, and on a tissue microarray block containing cores of various brain tumours. Based on these trials, we selected the best performing antibody and analysed a cohort of 417 extra- and intra-axial brain tumours such as gliomas, medulloblastomas, primary diffuse large B-cell lymphomas, and meningiomas. HCMV protein pp65 immunoreactivity was observed in all types of tumours analysed, and the IHC expression did not depend on the patient's age, gender, tumour type, or grade. The labelling pattern observed in the tumours differed from the labelling pattern observed in the tissue with an active HCMV infection. The HCMV protein was expressed in up to 90% of all the tumours investigated. Our results are in accordance with previous reports regarding the HCMV protein expression in glioblastomas and medulloblastomas. In addition, the HCMV protein expression was seen in primary brain lymphomas, low-grade gliomas, and in meningiomas. Our results indicate that the HCMV protein pp65 expression is common in intra- and extra-axial brain tumours. Thus, the assessment of the HCMV expression in tumours of various origins and pathologically altered tissue in conditions such as inflammation, infection, and even degeneration should certainly be facilitated."
454,"Overexpression of Extracellular Superoxide Dismutase Protects against Brain Injury Induced by Chronic Hypoxia."
455,"Extracellular superoxide dismutase (EC-SOD) is an isoform of SOD normally found both intra- and extra-cellularly and accounting for most SOD activity in blood vessels. Here we explored the role of EC-SOD in protecting against brain damage induced by chronic hypoxia. EC-SOD Transgenic mice, were exposed to hypoxia (FiO2.1%) for 10 days (H-KI) and compared to transgenic animals housed in room air (RA-KI), wild type animals exposed to hypoxia (H-WT or wild type mice housed in room air (RA-WT). Overall brain metabolism evaluated by positron emission tomography (PET) showed that H-WT mice had significantly higher uptake of 18FDG in the brain particularly the hippocampus, hypothalamus, and cerebellum. H-KI mice had comparable uptake to the RA-KI and RA-WT groups. To investigate the functional state of the hippocampus, electrophysiological techniques in ex vivo hippocampal slices were performed and showed that H-KI had normal synaptic plasticity, whereas H-WT were severely affected. Markers of oxidative stress, GFAP, IBA1, MIF, and pAMPK showed similar values in the H-KI and RA-WT groups, but were significantly increased in the H-WT group. Caspase-3 assay and histopathological studies showed significant apoptosis/cell damage in the H-WT group, but no significant difference in the H-KI group compared to the RA groups. The data suggest that EC-SOD has potential prophylactic and therapeutic roles in diseases with compromised brain oxygenation."
456,"Neutralization of Schwann Cell-Secreted VEGF Is Protective to In Vitro and In Vivo Experimental Diabetic Neuropathy."
457,"The pathogenetic role of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in long-term retinal and kidney complications of diabetes has been demonstrated. Conversely, little is known in diabetic neuropathy. We examined the modulation of VEGF pathway at mRNA and protein level on dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons and Schwann cells (SC) induced by hyperglycaemia. Moreover, we studied the effects of VEGF neutralization on hyperglycemic DRG neurons and streptozotocin-induced diabetic neuropathy. Our findings demonstrated that DRG neurons were not affected by the direct exposition to hyperglycaemia, whereas showed an impairment of neurite outgrowth ability when exposed to the medium of SC cultured in hyperglycaemia. This was mediated by an altered regulation of VEGF and FLT-1 receptors. Hyperglycaemia increased VEGF and FLT-1 mRNA without changing their intracellular protein levels in DRG neurons, decreased intracellular and secreted protein levels without changing mRNA level in SC, while reduced the expression of the soluble receptor sFLT-1 both in DRG neurons and SC. Bevacizumab, a molecule that inhibits VEGF activity preventing the interaction with its receptors, restored neurite outgrowth and normalized FLT-1 mRNA and protein levels in co-cultures. In diabetic rats, it both prevented and restored nerve conduction velocity and nociceptive thresholds. We demonstrated that hyperglycaemia early affected neurite outgrowth through the impairment of SC-derived VEGF/FLT-1 signaling and that the neutralization of SC-secreted VEGF was protective both in vitro and in vivo models of diabetic neuropathy."
458,"Microsatellite Polymorphism in the Heme Oxygenase-1 Gene Promoter and the Risk of Atrial Fibrillation in Taiwanese."
459,"BACKGROUND: Atrial fibrillation (AF) is associated with increased oxidative stress. Emerging evidence suggests that heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) is a potent antioxidant system against various oxidative stress-related diseases. The human HO-1 promoter has a GT-repeat length polymorphism that can determine the level of gene transcription. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to assess the role of the GT-repeat polymorphism in the promoter region of the HO-1 gene in Chinese-Taiwanese patients with AF. METHODS AND RESULTS: This study enrolled 200 AF patients and 240 controls, comparable for age and gender. In each subject, the length of GT-repeat polymorphism in the HO-1 promoter region was examined by polymerase chain reactions. The frequencies of long GT-repeat alleles (>==32) were significantly higher in AF patients than in controls. Multivariate analysis showed that the presence of long allele was significantly and independently associated with AF (odds ratio: 1.91, 95% CI 1.07-3.72; P = 0.028). Right atrial tissues from patients with chronic AF were investigated with immunoconfocal microscopy. Patients homozygous for shorter GT-repeat alleles exhibited greater HO-1 expression in their atria than those homozygous for longer alleles, which was reflected by less oxidative stress, myofibril degradation, and fibrosis in the atria of patients with shorter GT-repeat. In vitro, transient transfection assay in HL-1 atrial myocytes showed that the responsiveness of HO-1 transcriptional activity to tachypacing was inversely correlated with the length of the GT-repeats. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that the HO-1 microsatellite polymorphism may contribute to the genetic background of AF in Chinese-Taiwanese patients."
460,"The CXCL12 G801A Polymorphism Is Associated with Cancer Risk: A Meta-Analysis."
461,"BACKGROUND: CXCL12 is a small chemotactic cytokine belonging to the CXC chemokine family expressed in various organs. It contributes to the migration, invasion and angiogenesis of cancer cells. Recently, the CXCL12 G801A polymorphism was shown to be associated with an increased risk of various kinds of cancers, but the results were too inconsistent to be conclusive. METHODS: To solve the problem of inadequate statistical power and conflicting results, a meta-analysis of published case-control studies was performed, including 4,435 cancer cases and 6,898 controls. Odds ratios (ORs) and their 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were used to determine the strength of association between CXCL12 G801A polymorphism and cancer risk. RESULTS: A significant association between CXCL12 G801A polymorphism and cancer risk was found under all genetic models. Further, subgroup analysis stratified by ethnicity suggested a significant association between CXCL12 G801A polymorphism and cancer risk in the Asian subgroup under all genetic models. However, in the Caucasian subgroup, a significant association was only found under an additive genetic model and a dominant genetic model. The analysis stratified by cancer type found that CXCL12 G801A polymorphism may increase the risk of breast cancer, lung cancer, and ""other"" cancers. Based on subgroup stratified by source of controls, a significant association was observed in hospital-based studies under all genetic models. CONCLUSIONS: The CXCL12 G801A polymorphism is associated with an increased risk of cancer based on current published data. In the future, large-scale well-designed studies with more information are needed to better estimate possible gene-gene or gene-environment interactions."
462,"Diagnostic Value of a Rec-ELISA Using Toxoplasma gondii Recombinant SporoSAG, BAG1, and GRA1 Proteins in Murine Models Infected Orally with Tissue Cysts and Oocysts."
463,"Toxoplasma gondii causes congenital toxoplasmosis in newborns resulting with fetal anomalies. Determining the initiation time of infection is very important for pregnant women and current serological assays have drawbacks in distinguishing the recently acute toxoplasmosis. Diagnosis of recently acute infection may be improved by using stage specific antigens in serological assays. In the present study, the diagnostic value of sporozoite specific SporoSAG, bradyzoite specific BAG1 proteins and GRA1 protein expressed by all forms of the parasite have been evaluated ELISA using sera systematically collected from mice administered orally with tissue cyst and oocysts. The anti-SporoSAG IgM antibodies in sera obtained from mice infected with oocysts peaked significantly at days 1, 10, and 15 (P<0.01). The anti-BAG1 IgM antibodies in sera obtained from mice infected with tissue cysts peaked significantly at days 15, 40, and 120 (P<0.05). The anti-GRA1 IgM antibodies in sera obtained from mice infected with oocysts peaked significantly at days 2, 10, and 40 (P<0.01). The anti-GRA1 IgM antibodies in sera obtained from mice infected with tissue cysts peaked significantly only at day 40 (P<0.05). The anti-SporoSAG, anti-BAG1, and anti-GRA1 IgG titers of mice showed significant increases at day 40 (P<0.05) and decrement started for only anti-GRA1 IgG at day 120. The presence of anti-SporoSAG IgM and IgG antibodies can be interpreted as recently acute infection between days 10-40 because IgM decreases at day 40. Similarly, presence of anti-BAG1 IgM and absence of IgG can be evaluated as a recently acute infection that occurred 40 days before because IgG peaks at day 40. A peak in anti-GRA1 antibody level at first testing and reduction in consecutive sample can be considered as an infection approximately around day 40 or prior. Overall, recombinant SporoSAG, BAG1 and GRA1 proteins can be accepted as valuable diagnostic markers of recently acute toxoplasmosis."
464,"Adjuvant Potential of Selegiline in Attenuating Organ Dysfunction in Septic Rats with Peritonitis."
465,"Selegiline, an anti-Parkinson drug, has antioxidant and anti-apoptotic effects. To explore the effect of selegiline on sepsis, we used a clinically relevant animal model of polymicrobial sepsis. Cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) or sham operation was performed in male rats under anesthesia. Three hours after surgery, animals were randomized to receive intravenously selegiline (3 mg/kg) or an equivalent volume of saline. The administration of CLP rats with selegiline (i) increased arterial blood pressure and vascular responsiveness to norepinephrine, (ii) reduced plasma liver and kidney dysfunction, (iii) attenuated metabolic acidosis, (iv) decreased neutrophil infiltration in liver and lung, and (v) improved survival rate (from 44% to 65%), compared to those in the CLP alone rats. The CLP-induced increases of plasma interleukin-6, organ superoxide levels, and liver inducible nitric oxide synthase and caspase-3 expressions were ameliorated by selegiline treatment. In addition, the histological changes in liver and lung were significantly attenuated in the selegiline -treated CLP group compared to those in the CLP group. The improvement of organ dysfunction and survival through reducing inflammation, oxidative stress and apoptosis in peritonitis-induced sepsis by selegiline has potential as an adjuvant agent for critical ill."
466,"Genotype Distribution, Viral Load and Clinical Characteristics of Infants with Postnatal or Congenital Cytomegalovirus Infection."
467,"BACKGROUND: Congenital cytomegalovirus infection is a leading cause of long-term sequelae. Cytomegalovirus is also frequently transmitted to preterm infants postnatally, but these infections are mostly asymptomatic. A correlation between cytomegalovirus genotypes and clinical manifestations has been reported previously in infants with congenital infection, but not in preterm infants with postnatal infection. OBJECTIVES: The main objective of this study was to investigate cytomegalovirus genotype distribution in postnatal and congenital cytomegalovirus infection and its association with disease severity. METHODS: Infants admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit of the University Medical Center Utrecht, The Netherlands between 2003-2010 and diagnosed with postnatal or congenital cytomegalovirus infection were included. Classification of cytomegalovirus isolates in genotypes was performed upon amplification and sequencing of the cytomegalovirus UL55 (gB) and UL144 genes. Clinical data, cerebral abnormalities, neurodevelopmental outcome and viral load were studied in relation to genotype distribution. RESULTS: Genotyping results were obtained from 58 preterm infants with postnatal cytomegalovirus infection and 13 infants with congenital cytomegalovirus infection. Postnatal disease was mild in all preterm infants and all had favourable outcome. Infants with congenital infection were significantly more severely affected than infants with postnatal infection. Seventy-seven percent of these infants were symptomatic at birth, 2/13 died and 3/13 developed long-term sequelae (median follow-up 6 (range 2-8) years). The distribution of cytomegalovirus genotypes was comparable for postnatal and congenital infection. UL55 genotype 1 and UL144 genotype 3 were predominant genotypes in both groups. CONCLUSIONS: Distribution of UL55 and UL144 genotypes was similar in asymptomatic postnatal and severe congenital CMV infection suggesting that other factors rather than cytomegalovirus UL55 and UL144 genotype are responsible for the development of severe disease."
468,"Common Mental Disorder Symptoms among Patients with Malaria Attending Primary Care in Ethiopia: A Cross-Sectional Survey."
469,"BACKGROUND: Common Mental Disorders (CMDs) are frequent among patients attending primary care. In Africa, CMDs are often misdiagnosed as physical illnesses because many of the patients complain of somatic symptoms of mental distress. We explored whether there was difference in the levels of CMD symptoms between patients with thick film confirmed and clinical cases of malaria with negative thick film in primary care. METHODS: A cross-sectional comparative study was conducted on 300 adults with a clinical diagnosis of malaria in primary care centres in Jimma, Ethiopia. Patients were recruited consecutively until 100 cases of 'malaria' with a negative thick film and 200 cases of malaria with a positive thick film consented to participate. The 20-item Self-Reporting Questionnaire (SRQ-20) was used to measure CMD. The non-parametric Wilcoxon rank-sum test was used to explore the association between thick film result and CMD. RESULTS: Participants had a mean age of 28.2 (S.D = 10.9) years and the majority (57.3%) were women. The prevalence of high CMD symptoms (six or more symptoms on the SRQ-20) was 24.5%. Suicidal ideation was reported by 13.8% of the participants. CMD symptoms were significantly higher in patients who had taken medication prior to visiting the primary care (p = 0.012) and in those whose symptoms had been present for seven days or more (p = 0.041). There was no statistically significant association between level of CMD symptoms and having a negative thick film result (OR 0.98; 95%CI 0.92, 1.04) or objective presence of fever (OR 1.04; 95%CI 0.93, 1.15). CONCLUSIONS: CMD symptoms among cases of malaria did not appear to be associated with a negative thick film result. The high levels of CMD symptoms, including suicidal ideation, calls for further studies to investigate the persistence and progression of these symptoms following resolution of the acute malarial episode."
470,"Favorable interleukin-8 induction in human gingival epithelial cells by the antimicrobial peptide LL-37."
471,"BACKGROUND: LL-37, the only member of the antimicrobial peptide cathelicidin family in humans, exerts a variety of biological activities, especially immunomodulation through either direct chemotactic activity or up-regulation of several cytokines and chemokines in various cell types. In this study, we aimed to determine the immunoregulatory effect of LL-37 on Th1/Th2 cytokine expression and production in human gingival epithelial cells (HGECs). METHODS: Cultured HGECs were treated with different concentrations of LL-37 for different numbers of times. The cytotoxicity of LL-37 was determined by an MTT assay. Total RNA was isolated for RT-PCR and real-time PCR analyses of cytokine expression. Cell-free culture supernatants were assayed for Th1/Th2 cytokine levels by a cytokine bead array. RESULTS: Out of eleven Th1/Th2 cytokines tested, treatment of HGECs with non-toxic doses of LL-37 (2-6 muM) significantly raised only IL-8 levels in the cell-free culture supernatants, when compared to control untreated cells (P <0.05). Consistent with the elevated IL-8 levels, IL-8 mRNA expression was remarkably and significantly induced by LL-37 treatment (P < 0.05), when compared to the modest mRNA induction of other three cytokines, including IL-1beta, IL-6, and TNF-alpha. The time-course study demonstrated a cumulative IL-8 mRNA induction by LL-37 treatment within a 24-hour interval. CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate that LL-37 favorably induces IL-8 expression and secretion in HGECs, suggesting both direct and indirect involvement of LL-37 in neutrophil recruitment into an inflammatory site within diseased periodontal tissues."
472,"Cutaneous adverse reactions to calcium channel blockers."
473,"BACKGROUND: Previous studies have shown that calcium channel blockers can cause cutaneous adverse reactions; however, the amounts of data collected are limited. Recently, there have been new drugs available for which only a few reports have been published with regard to cutaneous adverse reactions. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of our study was to estimate the rate and to study clinical patterns of cutaneous adverse drug reactions to calcium channel blockers. METHODS: Medical records of patients who had cutaneous adverse reactions to calcium channel blockers between January 2004 and December 2010, at the Adverse Drug Reaction Center of Siriraj hospital, Mahidol University, Bangkok, Thailand were reviewed. RESULTS: From 996,583 prescriptions of calcium channel blockers, forty six patients developed cutaneous adverse effects. Diltiazem was the drug that showed the highest rate of cutaneous reactions per million prescriptions. Maculopapular rash was the most common dermatologic manifestation (41.7%), followed by ankle/pedal edema (18.8%). Three patients (6.2%) developed Stevens-Johnson syndrome due to amlodipine and 1 patient (2.1%) developed toxic epidermal necrolysis due to manidipine. Four patients (8.7%) had renal or cardiovascular involvement. CONCLUSIONS: It is important to keep in mind that some patients may develop cutaneous adverse reactions, including severe reactions, from calcium channel blockers."
474,"Reduction of serum TARC levels in atopic dermatitis by topical anti-inflammatory treatments."
475,"BACKGROUND: Serum thymus and activation-regulated chemokine (TARC) levels are associated with the disease activity of patients with atopic dermatitis (AD) and sensitively reflect short-term changes in skin conditions. The main treatment for AD is topical agent application. OBJECTIVE: This study investigated the relationship between serum TARC levels and the dosage of topical agents, including corticosteroids and/or tacrolimus, in patients with AD. METHODS: The serum TARC levels of 56 AD patients and the amounts of topical agents prescribed to them were investigated retrospectively. The weekly reduction in serum TARC levels and weekly dosage of topical agents among AD patients were compared and their associations were evaluated. RESULTS: The dosage of topical agents was closely related to serum TARC levels. One gram of strong rank steroid or the equivalent amount of steroid/tacrolimus is required to reduce serum TARC levels by 9.94 pg/mL weekly in moderate to severe AD patients. Higher initial TARC levels require more topical agent, which results in a more rapid decrease in TARC levels. The serum TARC levels and eosinophil numbers in peripheral blood are significantly correlated. CONCLUSION: Serum TARC level improvement and topical agent dosage are strongly correlated. TARC and eosinophil numbers are significantly correlated, but the wider range of TARC levels seems to be clinically more useful for monitoring AD severity. The serum TARC level is a very sensitive biomarker for monitoring the severity and treatment response in AD."
476,"Is fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) associated with asthma control in children?"
477,"INTRODUCTION: The most important way to achieve and maintain asthma control is to reduce airway inflammation. Fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) levels have been used as a marker of airway inflammation. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the association between FeNO levels and the asthma control status in children. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional clinical trial in children with atopic asthma aged >/= 7 years. The levels of asthma control were assessed by using the criteria from the GINA Guideline. FeNO levels and spirometry were measured. Asthma medications were recorded. The association between FeNO levels and asthma control status and the usage of asthma medications were analyzed. RESULTS: One hundred and fourteen asthmatic children aged 12.1 +/- 3.5 years were recruited into the study. Most of the patients had mild persistent asthma (79.8%). The administration of inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) was reported in 82.4% of cases. According to the GINA Guideline, 34.2% of cases were controlled, 44.7% were partly controlled and 21.1% were uncontrolled. We found that there was no significant difference in the median FeNO levels in the controlled, partly controlled and uncontrolled groups [19.2 (95% CI 5.1-108.9), 24.9 (2.2-85.7), and 39.2 (2.4-192.3) ppb, respectively (p = 0.24)]. However, in 20 cases who did not receive ICS treatment, the median FeNO levels showed a significant difference among controlled, partly controlled and uncontrolled groups [31.8 (95% CI 11.1-108.9), 34.1 (5.3-81.8), 92.0 (46.3-192.3) ppb, respectively; p <0.05]. CONCLUSIONS: FeNO levels were increased in ICS-treated asthmatic patients with less asthma control, albeit with no statistically significance. However, FeNO levels correlated with poor asthma control status in ICS untreated cases."
478,"Decreased concentration of IL-35 in plasma of patients with asthma and COPD."
479,"BACKGROUND: IL-35 has been found to be involved in many inflammatory diseases in humans but its role in asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is not clear. The plasma level of IL-35 in patients with asthma and COPD needs to be measured. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to examine the plasma concentrations of IL-35 in newly diagnosed asthmatic and COPD patients and control subjects and investigate correlations of lung function, age, sex, smoking history with the levels of IL-35 in plasma in these diseases. METHODS: Blood samples were collected from patients with newly diagnosed asthma (44, 12 males, aged 33.75?8.94), newly diagnosed COPD (36, 36 males, aged 68.03+/-8.94), and healthy control groups (23, 9 males, aged 30.06+/-7.50). We determined the IL-35 levels in plasma by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. RESULT: The median and the range of values for IL-35 were 118.55 pg/ml (range 74.43~1767.22 pg/ml) in patients with asthma, 136.09 pg/ml (range 62.54~697.49 pg/ml) in patients with COPD and 275.86 pg/ml (range 26.11~1766.20 pg/ml) in control subjects. The levels of IL-35 in plasma showed a positive correlation with FEV1% and FVC% in asthmatic patients whose plasma IL-35 values were over 150 pg/ml. A positive correlation was also found between plasma IL-35 and FVC% in COPD patients whose plasma IL-35 values were over 150 pg/ml. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that IL-35 may very probably be involved in the Th2 and Th17 mediated inflammation process of asthma and COPD. Its role in the mechanisms of COPD and asthma in human beings, as well as its therapeutic value in these diseases, need further investigation."
480,"Smooth muscle progenitor cells involved in the development of airway remodeling in a murine model of asthma."
481,"BACKGROUND: The mechanisms regulating airway remodeling changes remain poorly understood. Recently, a smooth muscle progenitor cell was identified in the peripheral circulatory system that plays an important role in the reconstruction of injured blood vessels. However, to the best of our knowledge, there is no report in the medical literature regarding the role of smooth muscle progenitor cells (SPCs) in asthma. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between SPCs and the development of airway remodelling in a murine model of asthma. METHODS: Chronic asthma with airway remodeling was generated by sensitizing and stimulating BALB/c mice with atomized ovalbumin (OVA). Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) was collected for eosinophils (EOS) counting and histological analysis. The Ficoll method was used to isolate mononuclear cells from peripheral blood. Smooth muscle myosin heavy chain (SM-MHC) and highly glycosylated type I transmembrane protein (CD34+) were selected as two markers to detect the expression of SPCs by Flow Cytometry. RESULTS: Long-term inhalation of OVA produced thickening of the epithelial and smooth muscle layer, goblet cell hyperplasia, collagen deposition around smooth muscle, luminal exudates and inflammatory cell infiltration. The number of SPCs in the asthma group was significantly higher than in the control group. CONCLUSION: Long-term inhalation of OVA results in airway remodeling and the smooth progenitor muscle cell are involved in the development of airway remodeling."
482,"Immunotherapy in food allergy: towards new strategies."
483,"Allergen avoidance is the standard treatment for managing food allergies. Complete avoidance is difficult, and accidental exposure often occurs. Immunotherapy is a significant focus for treating food allergies, and oral immunotherapy (OIT) appears to be particularly effective in inducing desensitization. The majority of patients who receive OIT show increased threshold doses of their food allergen. The efficacy of OIT is different among food antigen, and milk OIT is relatively difficult to achieve tolerance. OIT may induce mild to moderate symptoms during the therapy, widespread acceptance of OIT for long-term therapy is unclear. Recently, novel immunotherapies for food allergies, such as sublingual immunotherapy (SLIT), and epicutaneous immunotherapy (EPIT) and using an anti-IgE monoclonal antibody (omalizumab), have been assessed. In addition, a combination of OIT with omalizumab, which was found to increase the threshold doses of the offending foods without producing adverse reactions, may be effective and useful in the treatment of food allergies. These treatments have been used only in research settings; further studies in large numbers of patients are needed to demonstrate their long-term safety and benefits in clinical practice."
484,"Effects of the calcium channel blockers Phalphabeta and omega-conotoxin MVIIA on capsaicin and acetic acid-induced visceral nociception in mice."
485,"The effects of intrathecal administration of the toxins Phalpha1beta and omega-conotoxin MVIIA were investigated in visceral nociception induced by an intraperitoneal injection of acetic acid and an intracolonic application of capsaicin. The pretreatments for two hours with the toxins reduced the number of writhes or nociceptive behaviors compared with the control mice. Phalpha1beta administration resulted in an Imax of 84+/-6 and an ID50 of 12 (5 - 27), and omega-conotoxin MVIIA resulted in an Imax of 82+/-9 and an ID50 of 11 (4-35) in the contortions induced by the intraperitoneal injection of acetic acid. The administration of Phalpha1beta resulted in an Imax of 64+/-4 and an ID50 of 18 (9 - 38), and omega-conotoxin MVIIA resulted in an Imax of 71+/-9 and an ID50 of 9 (1 -83) in the contortions induced by intracolonic capsaicin administration. Phalpha1beta (100 pmol/site) or omega-conotoxin MVIIA (30 pmol/site) pretreatments caused a reduction in CSF glutamate release in mice intraperitoneally injected with acetic acid or treated with intracolonic capsaicin. The toxins pretreatments reduced the ROS levels induced by intraperitoneal acetic acid injection. Phalpha1beta, but not omega-conotoxin MVIIA, reduced significantly the ROS levels induced by intracolonic capsaicin administration. Perspective: Phalpha1beta is a omega-toxin with high therapeutic index and a broader action on calcium channels. It shows analgesic effect in several rodents' models of pain, including visceral pain, suggesting that this toxin has the potential to be used in clinical setting as a drug in the control of persistent pathological pain."
486,"Lipopolysaccharide Repeated Challenge Followed by Chronic Mild Stress Protocol Introduces a Combined Model of Depression in Rats: Reversibility by Imipramine and Pentoxifylline."
487,"OBJECTIVES: The present study examined the hypothesis that combined exposure to repeated challenge using low doses of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and chronic mild stress (CMS) together This combined exposure is thought to expose the animals to more realistic challenges, testable on different levels (behavioral, neurochemical, immunohistochemical and gene expression). The role of glial cells was examined, as well. Additionally, the effects of chronic administration of tricyclic antidepressant, imipramine and anti-TNF-alpha, pentoxyphylline were investigated. METHODS: Wistar rats were exposed to either repeated LPS (50mug/kgi.p.) over 2weeks, CMS protocol for 4weeks or LPS over 2weeks then 4weeks CMS. Two groups of rats were exposed to LPS/CMS protocol and treated with either imipramine or pentoxifylline. Rats were examined for behavioral, neurochemical and gene expression changes. RESULTS: Animals exposed to LPS/CMS elaborated depressive-like symptoms with significant increase in both serum corticosterone and TNF-alpha level compared to saline, LPS or CMS groups. Hippocampal kynurenine/tryptophan ratio and TNF-alpha gene expression showed significant increase in the LPS/CMS model compared to saline, LPS or CMS groups. The immunohistochemical findings, scrutinized the topography of the examined effects. Chronic treatment with imipramine or pentoxifylline significantly ameliorated the behavioral, neurochemical, immunohistochemical and TNF-alpha gene expression changes induced by the LPS/CMS protocol. CONCLUSION: This study gave a clue to the neurobiological processes underlying, at least subtypes of depressive disorders. It highlighted the possible interactions between stress and immune-inflammatory pathways in the pathogenesis of depression and suggested a new animal model of depression that addresses these pathways."
488,"Clinical outcome after endoscopic resection for superficial pharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma invading the subepithelial layer."
489,"Background and study aims: The curability of endoscopic resection for superficial pharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (SPSCC) has not been fully elucidated, particularly for lesions invading the subepithelial layer, which carry the risk of metastasis. The aim of this study was to evaluate the curative potential of endoscopic resection for SPSCC invading the subepithelial layer. Patients and methods: From June 2002 to July 2010, 198 SPSCCs in 176 consecutive patients were treated by endoscopic resection at two tertiary referral centers. Selection criteria were initial endoscopic resection, histologically proven squamous cell carcinoma invading the subepithelial layer, no lymph node or distant metastasis before endoscopic resection, and no prior treatment for pharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma. Endoscopic resection was performed under general anesthesia. Long-term survival and clinical outcomes were retrospectively evaluated. Results: Among 176 consecutive patients, 50 lesions in 47 patients (all male; median age 64 years) were histologically diagnosed from endoscopic resection specimens as having subepithelial invasion. Median tumor thickness was 1000 mum (range 200 - 10 000 mum). Six patients developed local recurrence (13 %; 95 % confidence interval [CI] 3.1 % - 22.4 %), and all were cured with organ-preserving intervention. After a median follow-up period of 71 months (range 27 - 116 months), one patient (2 %; 95 %CI 0 - 6.3 %) developed neck lymph node metastasis. A total of 14 patients (30 %) were followed for 5 years or more, and 5-year overall survival and disease-specific survival rates were 84.5 % (95 %CI 73 % - 96 %) and 100 %, respectively. Conclusions: Endoscopic resection has curative potential as a minimally invasive treatment option for SPSCC that invades the subepithelial layer."
490,"A novel lumen-apposing metal stent for endoscopic ultrasound-guided drainage of pancreatic fluid collections: a prospective cohort study."
491,"Background and study aims: A novel large-diameter, lumen-apposing, self-expanding metal stent with bilateral flanges was recently developed for endoscopic ultrasound (EUS)-guided transmural drainage of symptomatic pancreatic fluid collections (PFCs). The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of this stent in a large cohort. Patients and methods: Patients with a PFC undergoing EUS-guided drainage with this novel stent were prospectively enrolled in this multicenter cohort study. Results: There were 61 patients: 46 patients (75 %) with walled-off necrosis (WON) and 15 (25 %) with a pancreatic pseudocyst. Stent placement was technically successful in 60 patients (98 %, 95 %CI 95 % - 100 %). Clinical success, defined as resolution of clinical symptoms in combination with a decrease in the PFC size to </= 2 cm on imaging, was achieved in 93 % of patients with a pancreatic pseudocyst (95 %CI 77 % - 100 %) and in 81 % of patients with WON (95 %CI 69 % - 94 %). Treatment failure occurred in nine patients (16 %, 95 %CI 6 % - 26 %), including four patients who required surgical intervention. Stent removal was performed in 82 % of patients after a median of 32 days (range 2 - 178) and was rated as easy in all but one patient. In 10 patients, endoscopic stent removal was not performed because of stent migration (n = 3), stent dislodgement during necrosectomy (n = 3), stent removal during surgery (n = 2), or refusal by the patient (n = 2). In total, five major complications were reported (9 %, 95 %CI 2 % - 16 %), including PFC infection (n = 4) and perforation (n = 1). Conclusion: EUS-guided drainage using this novel stent is feasible and the clinical results obtained are promising with a low major complication rate."
492,"A new fully covered metal stent with anti-migration features for the treatment of malignant dysphagia."
493,"Background and study aims: A new esophageal stent with two anti-migration features was developed to minimize migration. The aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical efficacy and safety of this stent in patients with malignant dysphagia. Patients and methods: A total of 40 patients with dysphagia due to a malignant obstruction of the esophagus were prospectively enrolled in this cohort study. Results: Stent placement was technically successful in 39 patients (98 %). The median dysphagia-free time after stent placement was 220 days (95 % confidence interval 94 - 345 days). Nine patients (23 %) experienced recurrent dysphagia due to tissue overgrowth (n = 2), stent fracture (n = 1), and partial (n = 5) or complete (n = 1) stent migration. A total of 16 serious adverse events occurred in 14 patients (36 %), with hemorrhage (n = 3) and severe nausea or vomiting (n = 3) being the most common causes. Conclusions: This new stent design was effective for the palliation of malignant dysphagia and had a low rate of recurrent dysphagia. However, despite the anti-migration features, stent migration was still a major cause of recurrent dysphagia. Furthermore, treatment was associated with a high adverse event rate.

494,"Clinical indications for computed tomographic colonography: European Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ESGE) and European Society of Gastrointestinal and Abdominal Radiology (ESGAR) Guideline."
495,"This is an official guideline of the European Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ESGE) and the European Society of Gastrointestinal and Abdominal Radiology (ESGAR). It addresses the clinical indications for the use of computed tomographic colonography (CTC). A targeted literature search was performed to evaluate the evidence supporting the use of CTC. The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) system was adopted to define the strength of recommendations and the quality of evidence. Main recommendations 1 ESGE/ESGAR recommend computed tomographic colonography (CTC) as the radiological examination of choice for the diagnosis of colorectal neoplasia. ESGE/ESGAR do not recommend barium enema in this setting (strong recommendation, high quality evidence). 2 ESGE/ESGAR recommend CTC, preferably the same or next day, if colonoscopy is incomplete. Delay of CTC should be considered following endoscopic resection. In the case of obstructing colorectal cancer, preoperative contrast-enhanced CTC may also allow location or staging of malignant lesions (strong recommendation, moderate quality evidence). 3 When endoscopy is contraindicated or not possible, ESGE/ESGAR recommend CTC as an acceptable and equally sensitive alternative for patients with symptoms suggestive of colorectal cancer (strong recommendation, high quality evidence). 4 ESGE/ESGAR recommend referral for endoscopic polypectomy in patients with at least one polyp >/= 6 mm in diameter detected at CTC. CTC surveillance may be clinically considered if patients do not undergo polypectomy (strong recommendation, moderate quality evidence). 5 ESGE/ESGAR do not recommend CTC as a primary test for population screening or in individuals with a positive first-degree family history of colorectal cancer (CRC). However, it may be proposed as a CRC screening test on an individual basis providing the screenee is adequately informed about test characteristics, benefits, and risks (weak recommendation, moderate quality evidence)."
496,"In Vivo Microstructural Analysis of Enamel in Permanent and Deciduous Teeth."
497,"Abstract Confocal microscope was used to analyze human enamel from 10 deciduous and 10 permanent teeth. Optically sectioned images were obtained. A more intense autofluorescence was found in primary teeth. This finding might be due to the greater presence of organic substances in deciduous enamel. The mean prism diameter measurement in permanent teeth enamel was 3.150 microm and 2.602 microm in deciduous teeth. The mean prism diameter in deciduous teeth was statistically least. The results indicate that a confocal microscope may be of help in analyzing and defining the microscopic features of human enamel."
498,"Establishing a Quantitative Benchmark for Morbidity in Pancreatoduodenectomy Using ACS-NSQIP, the Accordion Severity Grading System, and the Postoperative Morbidity Index."
499,"OBJECTIVE:: The study aim was to quantify the burden of complications of pancreatoduodenectomy (PD). BACKGROUND:: The Postoperative Morbidity Index (PMI) is a quantitative measure of the average burden of complications of a procedure. It is based on highly validated systems-ACS-NSQIP and the Modified Accordion Severity Grading System. METHODS:: Nine centers contributed ACS-NSQIP complication data for 1589 patients undergoing PD from 2005 to 2011. Each complication was assigned a severity weight ranging from 0.11 for the least severe complication to 1.00 for postoperative death, and PMI was derived. Contribution to total burden by each complication grade was used to generate a severity profile (""spectrogram"") for PD. Associations with PMI were determined by regression analysis. RESULTS:: ACS-NSQIP complications occurred in 528 cases (33.2%). The non-risk-adjusted PMI was 0.115 (SD = 0.023) for all centers and 0.113 (SD = 0.005) for the 7 centers that contributed at least 100 cases. Grade 2 complications were predominant in frequency, and the most common complication was postoperative bleeding/transfusion. Frequency and burden of complications differed markedly. For instance, severe complications (grades 4/5/6) accounted for only about 20% of complications but for more than 40% of the burden of complications. Organ space infection had the highest burden of any complication. The average burden in cases in which a complication actually occurred was 0.346. CONCLUSIONS:: This study develops a quantitative non-risk-adjusted benchmark for postoperative morbidity of PD. The method quantifies the burden of types and grades of postoperative complications and should prove useful in identifying areas that require quality improvement."
500,"Endogenous galactose formation in galactose-1-phosphate uridyltransferase deficiency."
501,"Abstract Patients with classical galactosaemia (galactose-1-phosphate uridyltransferase (GALT) deficiency) manifest clinical complications despite strict dietary galactose restriction. Therefore the significance of endogenous galactose production has been assessed. Previous in vivo studies primarily focused on patients homozygous for the most common genetic variant Q188R but little is known about other genetic variants. In the present study the endogenous galactose release in a group of non-Q188R homozygous galactosaemic patients (n = 17; 4-34 years) exhibiting comparably low residual GALT activity in red blood cells was investigated. Primed continuous infusion studies with D-[1-13C]galactose as substrate were conducted under post-absorptive conditions and in good metabolic control. The results demonstrate that all patients exhibiting residual GALT activity of <1.5% of control showed a comparable pathological pattern of increased endogenous galactose release irrespective of the underlying genetic variations. Possible implications of the findings towards a more differentiated dietary regimen in galactosaemia are discussed."
502,"Effect of High-Dose Vitamin D3 on Hospital Length of Stay in Critically Ill Patients With Vitamin D Deficiency: The VITdAL-ICU Randomized Clinical Trial."
503,"Importance: Low vitamin D status is linked to increased mortality and morbidity in patients who are critically ill. It is unknown if this association is causal. Objective: To investigate whether a vitamin D3 treatment regimen intended to restore and maintain normal vitamin D status over 6 months is of health benefit for patients in ICUs. Design, Setting, and Participants: A randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled, single-center trial, conducted from May 2010 through September 2012 at 5 ICUs that included a medical and surgical population of 492 critically ill adult white patients with vitamin D deficiency (</=20 ng/mL) assigned to receive either vitamin D3 (n = 249) or a placebo (n = 243). Interventions: Vitamin D3 or placebo was given orally or via nasogastric tube once at a dose of 540 000 IU followed by monthly maintenance doses of 90 000 IU for 5 months. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was hospital length of stay. Secondary outcomes included, among others, length of ICU stay, the percentage of patients with 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels higher than 30 ng/mL at day 7, hospital mortality, and 6-month mortality. A predefined severe vitamin D deficiency (</=12 ng/mL) subgroup analysis was specified before data unblinding and analysis. Results: A total of 475 patients were included in the final analysis (237 in the vitamin D3 group and 238 in the placebo group). The median (IQR) length of hospital stay was not significantly different between groups (20.1 days [IQR, 11.1-33.3] for vitamin D3 vs 19.3 days [IQR, 11.1-34.9] for placebo; P = .98). Hospital mortality and 6-month mortality were also not significantly different (hospital mortality: 28.3% [95% CI, 22.6%-34.5%] for vitamin D3 vs 35.3% [95% CI, 29.2%-41.7%] for placebo; hazard ratio [HR], 0.81 [95% CI, 0.58-1.11]; P = .18; 6-month mortality: 35.0% [95% CI, 29.0%-41.5%] for vitamin D3 vs 42.9% [95% CI, 36.5%-49.4%] for placebo; HR, 0.78 [95% CI, 0.58-1.04]; P = .09). For the severe vitamin D deficiency subgroup analysis (n = 200), length of hospital stay was not significantly different between the 2 study groups: 20.1 days (IQR, 12.9-39.1) for vitamin D3 vs 19.0 days (IQR, 11.6-33.8) for placebo. Hospital mortality was significantly lower with 28 deaths among 98 patients (28.6% [95% CI, 19.9%-38.6%]) for vitamin D3 compared with 47 deaths among 102 patients (46.1% [95% CI, 36.2%-56.2%]) for placebo (HR, 0.56 [95% CI, 0.35-0.90], P for interaction = .04), but not 6-month mortality (34.7% [95% CI, 25.4%-45.0%] for vitamin D3 vs 50.0% [95% CI, 39.9%-60.1%] for placebo; HR, 0.60 [95% CI, 0.39-0.93], P for interaction = .12). Conclusions and Relevance: Among critically ill patients with vitamin D deficiency, administration of high-dose vitamin D3 compared with placebo did not reduce hospital length of stay, hospital mortality, or 6-month mortality. Lower hospital mortality was observed in the severe vitamin D deficiency subgroup, but this finding should be considered hypothesis generating and requires further study.

504,"Antibiotic consumption in relation to socio-demographic factors, co-morbidity, and accessibility of primary health care."
505,"Background: Differences in antibiotic consumption between individuals are not only due to differences in primary infection morbidity, other non-medical factors are important. Our objective was to investigate how socio-demographic factors, co-morbidity, and access to primary care affect antibiotic prescribing. Methods: The study population included all 2 078 481 persons in Sweden who received at least one antibiotic prescription during 2010, and an unmatched control population of 788 580 individuals. We used record linkage to obtain data on co-morbidity, various socio-demographic variables, and waiting times for doctor appointments in primary care. We used logistic regression to estimate odds ratios (ORs) for antibiotic prescription. Results: The results showed that over 20% of the population were prescribed antibiotics during 2010. Children aged 0-5 years, persons >/= 75 years of age, those living in urban areas, and women compared with men, received many prescriptions. Co-morbidity was a strong factor that determined the number of antibiotic prescriptions: those with Charlson's index >/= 3 had an OR of 3.03 (95% CI: 3.00-3.07) to obtain antibiotics in the adjusted analysis, compared with individuals without co-morbidity (Charlson's index 0). Short waiting times for a doctor's visit in primary care were associated with a higher number of antibiotic prescriptions. Individuals born in Sweden were prescribed more antibiotics compared with those born in another country. Specifically, persons born in any of the 27 EU countries (excluding Scandinavia) had an OR of antibiotic prescription of 0.78 (95% CI: 0.77-0.78) compared with native-born individuals. Conclusions: We conclude that non-medical factors strongly influence antibiotic prescriptions."
506,"Primary prevention of CVD: diet."
507,"INTRODUCTION: Diet is important in the cause of many chronic diseases. Individual change in dietary behaviour has the potential to decrease the burden of chronic disease, particularly cardiovascular disease (CVD). METHODS AND OUTCOMES: We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical question: What are the effects of dietary advice in generally healthy adults without existing CVD or increased CVD risk factors to improve cardiovascular outcomes (mortality, cardiovascular events, and cardiovascular risk factors)? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to March 2014 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically; please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA). RESULTS: We found 14 studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions. CONCLUSIONS: In this systematic review, we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: advice to increase fibre intake alone, advice to increase fruit and vegetable intake alone, advice to reduce and/or modify fat intake alone, and advice to reduce sodium intake alone."
508,"Evaluation of the Validity of Job Exposure Matrix for Psychosocial Factors at Work."
509,"OBJECTIVE: To study the performance of a developed job exposure matrix (JEM) for the assessment of psychosocial factors at work in terms of accuracy, possible misclassification bias and predictive ability to detect known associations with depression and low back pain (LBP). MATERIALS AND METHODS: We utilized two large population surveys (the Health 2000 Study and the Finnish Work and Health Surveys), one to construct the JEM and another to test matrix performance. In the first study, information on job demands, job control, monotonous work and social support at work was collected via face-to-face interviews. Job strain was operationalized based on job demands and job control using quadrant approach. In the second study, the sensitivity and specificity were estimated applying a Bayesian approach. The magnitude of misclassification error was examined by calculating the biased odds ratios as a function of the sensitivity and specificity of the JEM and fixed true prevalence and odds ratios. Finally, we adjusted for misclassification error the observed associations between JEM measures and selected health outcomes. RESULTS: The matrix showed a good accuracy for job control and job strain, while its performance for other exposures was relatively low. Without correction for exposure misclassification, the JEM was able to detect the association between job strain and depression in men and between monotonous work and LBP in both genders. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that JEM more accurately identifies occupations with low control and high strain than those with high demands or low social support. Overall, the present JEM is a useful source of job-level psychosocial exposures in epidemiological studies lacking individual-level exposure information. Furthermore, we showed the applicability of a Bayesian approach in the evaluation of the performance of the JEM in a situation where, in practice, no gold standard of exposure assessment exists."
510,"Serum Amyloid A and Clusterin as Potential Predictive Biomarkers for Severe Hand, Foot and Mouth Disease by 2D-DIGE Proteomics Analysis."
511,"Hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD) affects more than one million children, is responsible for several hundred child deaths every year in China and is the cause of widespread concerns in society. Only a small fraction of HFMD cases will develop further into severe HFMD with neurologic complications. A timely and accurate diagnosis of severe HFMD is essential for assessing the risk of progression and planning the appropriate treatment. Human serum can reflect the physiological or pathological states, which is expected to be an excellent source of disease-specific biomarkers. In the present study, a comparative serological proteome analysis between severe HFMD patients and healthy controls was performed via a two-dimensional difference gel electrophoresis (2D-DIGE) and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) strategy. Fifteen proteins were identified as differentially expressed in the sera of the severe HFMD patients compared with the controls. The identified proteins were classified into different groups according to their molecular functions, biological processes, protein classes and physiological pathways by bioinformatics analysis. The up-regulations of two identified proteins, serum amyloid A (SAA) and clusterin (CLU), were confirmed in the sera of the HFMD patients by ELISA assay. This study not only increases our background knowledge about and scientific insight into the mechanisms of HFMD, but also reveals novel potential biomarkers for the clinical diagnosis of severe HFMD."
512,"Modulation of interhemispheric functional coordination in electroconvulsive therapy for depression."
513,"Considerable evidence suggests that depression is related to interhemispheric functional coordination deficits. For depression, electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is the most rapid and effective therapy, but its underlying mechanism remains unknown. The aim of this study was to explore the impact of ECT on the interhemispheric functional coordination in depression patients. We used resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging to observe the change of interhemispheric functional coordination with the method of voxel-mirrored homotopic connectivity (VMHC) in 11 depressed patients before and after ECT, compared with 15 healthy controls. The results showed that, compared with depression patients before ECT, VMHC was significantly increased in superior frontal gyri (BA 8), middle frontal gyri (two clusters: BA 8/9 and BA 10) and angular gyri (BA 39) in depression patients after ECT. Compared with healthy controls, VMHC in those areas was significantly lower in the middle frontal gyri (BA 8/9) and angular gyri (BA 39) in depression patients before ECT, but no significant difference was observed in the superior frontal gyri (BA 8) and middle frontal gyri (BA 10). There was no significant correlation between the changes of Hamilton Depression Rating Scale scores and changed VMHC values in those four areas in depression patients. The results suggest that ECT selectively modulated interhemispheric functional coordination in depression patients. Such may play an important mechanistic role in the treatment of depression, and may afford a useful avenue for optimizing treatment."
514,"Alteration of imprinted Dlk1-Dio3 miRNA cluster expression in the entorhinal cortex induced by maternal immune activation and adolescent cannabinoid exposure."
515,"A significant feature of the cortical neuropathology of schizophrenia is a disturbance in the biogenesis of short non-coding microRNA (miRNA) that regulate translation and stability of mRNA. While the biological origin of this phenomenon has not been defined, it is plausible that it relates to major environmental risk factors associated with the disorder such as exposure to maternal immune activation (MIA) and adolescent cannabis use. To explore this hypothesis, we administered the viral mimic poly I:C to pregnant rats and further exposed some of their maturing offsprings to daily injections of the synthetic cannabinoid HU210 for 14 days starting on postnatal day 35. Whole-genome miRNA expression analysis was then performed on the left and right hemispheres of the entorhinal cortex (EC), a region strongly associated with schizophrenia. Animals exposed to either treatment alone or in combination exhibited significant differences in the expression of miRNA in the left hemisphere, whereas the right hemisphere was less responsive. Hemisphere-associated differences in miRNA expression were greatest in the combined treatment and highly over-represented in a single imprinted locus on chromosome 6q32. This observation was significant as the syntenic 14q32 locus in humans encodes a large proportion of miRNAs differentially expressed in peripheral blood lymphocytes from patients with schizophrenia, suggesting that interaction of early and late environmental insults may affect miRNA expression, in a manner that is relevant to schizophrenia."
516,"Corneal blindness and xenotransplantation."
517,"Approximately 39 million people are blind worldwide, with an estimated 285 million visually impaired. The developing world shoulders 90% of the world's blindness, with 80% of causative diseases being preventable or treatable. Blindness has a major detrimental impact on the patient, community, and healthcare spending. Corneal diseases are significant causes of blindness, affecting at least 4 million people worldwide. The prevalence of corneal disease varies between parts of the world. Trachoma, for instance, is the second leading cause of blindness in Africa, after cataracts, but is rarely found today in developed nations. When preventive strategies have failed, corneal transplantation is the most effective treatment for advanced corneal disease. The major surgical techniques for corneal transplantation include penetrating keratoplasty (PK), anterior lamellar keratoplasty, and endothelial keratoplasty (EK). Indications for corneal transplantation vary between countries, with Fuchs' dystrophy being the leading indication in the USA and keratoconus in Australia. With the exception of the USA, where EK will soon overtake PK as the most common surgical procedure, PK is the overwhelming procedure of choice. Success using corneal grafts in developing nations, such as Nepal, demonstrates the feasibility of corneal transplantation on a global scale. The number of suitable corneas from deceased human donors that becomes available will never be sufficient, and so research into various alternatives, for example stem cells, amniotic membrane transplantation, synthetic and biosynthetic corneas, and xenotransplantation, is progressing. While each of these has potential, we suggest that xenotransplantation holds the greatest potential for a corneal replacement. With the increasing availability of genetically engineered pigs, pig corneas may alleviate the global shortage of corneas in the near future."
518,"Alterations at the Cross-Bridge Level Are Associated with a Paradoxical Gain of Muscle Function In Vivo in a Mouse Model of Nemaline Myopathy."
519,"Nemaline myopathy is the most common disease entity among non-dystrophic skeletal muscle congenital diseases. The first disease causing mutation (Met9Arg) was identified in the gene encoding alpha-tropomyosinslow gene (TPM3). Considering the conflicting findings of the previous studies on the transgenic (Tg) mice carrying the TPM3Met9Arg mutation, we investigated carefully the effect of the Met9Arg mutation in 8-9 month-old Tg(TPM3)Met9Arg mice on muscle function using a multiscale methodological approach including skinned muscle fibers analysis and in vivo investigations by magnetic resonance imaging and 31-phosphorus magnetic resonance spectroscopy. While in vitro maximal force production was reduced in Tg(TPM3)Met9Arg mice as compared to controls, in vivo measurements revealed an improved mechanical performance in the transgenic mice as compared to the former. The reduced in vitro muscle force might be related to alterations occuring at the cross-bridges level with muscle-specific underlying mechanisms. In vivo muscle improvement was not associated with any changes in either muscle volume or energy metabolism. Our findings indicate that TPM3(Met9Arg) mutation leads to a mild muscle weakness in vitro related to an alteration at the cross-bridges level and a paradoxical gain of muscle function in vivo. These results clearly point out that in vitro alterations are muscle-dependent and do not necessarily translate into similar changes in vivo."
520,"The Use of Surrogate Endpoints in Regulating Medicines for Cardio-Renal Disease: Opinions of Stakeholders."
521,"AIM: There is discussion whether medicines can be authorized on the market based on evidence from surrogate endpoints. We assessed opinions of different stakeholders on this topic. METHODS: We conducted an online questionnaire that targeted various stakeholder groups (regulatory agencies, pharmaceutical industry, academia, relevant public sector organisations) and medical specialties (cardiology or nephrology vs. other). Participants were enrolled through purposeful sampling. We inquired for conditions under which surrogate endpoints can be used, the validity of various cardio-renal biomarkers and new approaches for biomarker use. RESULTS: Participants agreed that surrogate endpoints can be used when the surrogate is scientifically valid (5-point Likert response format, mean score: 4.3, SD: 0.9) or when there is an unmet clinical need (mean score: 3.8, SD: 1.2). Industry participants agreed to a greater extent than regulators and academics. However, out of four proposed surrogates (blood pressure (BP), HbA1c, albuminuria, CRP) for cardiovascular outcomes or end-stage renal disease, only use of BP for cardiovascular outcomes was deemed moderately accurate (mean: 3.6, SD: 1.1). Specialists in cardiology or nephrology tended to be more positive about the use of surrogate endpoints. CONCLUSION: Stakeholders in drug development do not oppose to the use of surrogate endpoints in drug marketing authorization, but most surrogates are not considered valid. To solve this impasse, increased efforts are required to validate surrogate endpoints and to explore alternative ways to use them."
522,"Modes of Transmission of Influenza B Virus in Households."
523,"INTRODUCTION: While influenza A and B viruses can be transmitted via respiratory droplets, the importance of small droplet nuclei ""aerosols"" in transmission is controversial. METHODS AND FINDINGS: In Hong Kong and Bangkok, in 2008-11, subjects were recruited from outpatient clinics if they had recent onset of acute respiratory illness and none of their household contacts were ill. Following a positive rapid influenza diagnostic test result, subjects were randomly allocated to one of three household-based interventions: hand hygiene, hand hygiene plus face masks, and a control group. Index cases plus their household contacts were followed for 7-10 days to identify secondary infections by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing of respiratory specimens. Index cases with RT-PCR-confirmed influenza B were included in the present analyses. We used a mathematical model to make inferences on the modes of transmission, facilitated by apparent differences in clinical presentation of secondary infections resulting from aerosol transmission. We estimated that approximately 37% and 26% of influenza B virus transmission was via the aerosol mode in households in Hong Kong and Bangkok, respectively. In the fitted model, influenza B virus infections were associated with a 56%-72% risk of fever plus cough if infected via aerosol route, and a 23%-31% risk of fever plus cough if infected via the other two modes of transmission. CONCLUSIONS: Aerosol transmission may be an important mode of spread of influenza B virus. The point estimates of aerosol transmission were slightly lower for influenza B virus compared to previously published estimates for influenza A virus in both Hong Kong and Bangkok. Caution should be taken in interpreting these findings because of the multiple assumptions inherent in the model, including that there is limited biological evidence to date supporting a difference in the clinical features of influenza B virus infection by different modes."
524,"In Silico, Experimental, Mechanistic Model for Extended-Release Felodipine Disposition Exhibiting Complex Absorption and a Highly Variable Food Interaction."
525,"The objective of this study was to develop and explore new, in silico experimental methods for deciphering complex, highly variable absorption and food interaction pharmacokinetics observed for a modified-release drug product. Toward that aim, we constructed an executable software analog of study participants to whom product was administered orally. The analog is an object- and agent-oriented, discrete event system, which consists of grid spaces and event mechanisms that map abstractly to different physiological features and processes. Analog mechanisms were made sufficiently complicated to achieve prespecified similarity criteria. An equation-based gastrointestinal transit model with nonlinear mixed effects analysis provided a standard for comparison. Subject-specific parameterizations enabled each executed analog's plasma profile to mimic features of the corresponding six individual pairs of subject plasma profiles. All achieved prespecified, quantitative similarity criteria, and outperformed the gastrointestinal transit model estimations. We observed important subject-specific interactions within the simulation and mechanistic differences between the two models. We hypothesize that mechanisms, events, and their causes occurring during simulations had counterparts within the food interaction study: they are working, evolvable, concrete theories of dynamic interactions occurring within individual subjects. The approach presented provides new, experimental strategies for unraveling the mechanistic basis of complex pharmacological interactions and observed variability."
526,"Caenorhabditis elegans: A Simple Nematode Infection Model for Penicillium marneffei."
527,"Penicillium marneffei, one of the most important thermal dimorphic fungi, is a severe threat to the life of immunocompromised patients. However, the pathogenic mechanisms of P. marneffei remain largely unknown. In this work, we developed a model host by using nematode Caenorhabditis elegans to investigate the virulence of P. marneffei. Using two P. marneffei clinical isolate strains 570 and 486, we revealed that in both liquid and solid media, the ingestion of live P. marneffei was lethal to C. elegans (P<0.001). Meanwhile, our results showed that the strain 570, which can produce red pigment, had stronger pathogenicity in C. elegans than the strain 486, which can't produce red pigment (P<0.001). Microscopy showed the formation of red pigment and hyphae within C. elegans after incubation with P. marneffei for 4 h, which are supposed to be two contributors in nematodes killing. In addition, we used C. elegans as an in vivo model to evaluate different antifungal agents against P. marneffei, and found that antifungal agents including amphotericin B, terbinafine, fluconazole, itraconazole and voriconazole successfully prolonged the survival of nematodesinfected by P. marneffei. Overall, this alternative model host can provide us an easy tool to study the virulence of P. marneffei and screen antifungal agents."

530,"Genotyping of the Duffy Blood Group among Plasmodium knowlesi-Infected Patients in Malaysia."
531,"The Duffy blood group is of major interest in clinical medicine as it plays an important role in Plasmodium knowlesi and Plasmodium vivax infection. In the present study, the distribution of Duffy blood group genotypes and allelic frequencies among P. knowlesi infected patients as well as healthy individuals in Peninsular Malaysia were determined. The blood group of 60 healthy blood donors and 51 P. knowlesi malaria patients were genotyped using allele specific polymerase chain reaction (ASP-PCR). The data was analyzed using Fisher's exact test in order to assess the significance of the variables. Our results show a high proportion of the FY*A/FY*A genotype (>85% for both groups) and a high frequency of the FY*A allele (>90% for both groups). The FY*A/FY*A genotype was the most predominant genotype in both infected and healthy blood samples. The genotype frequency did not differ significantly between the donor blood and the malaria patient groups. Also, there was no significant correlation between susceptibility to P. knowlesi infection with any Duffy blood genotype."
532,"Annotated Chemical Patent Corpus: A Gold Standard for Text Mining."
533,"Exploring the chemical and biological space covered by patent applications is crucial in early-stage medicinal chemistry activities. Patent analysis can provide understanding of compound prior art, novelty checking, validation of biological assays, and identification of new starting points for chemical exploration. Extracting chemical and biological entities from patents through manual extraction by expert curators can take substantial amount of time and resources. Text mining methods can help to ease this process. To validate the performance of such methods, a manually annotated patent corpus is essential. In this study we have produced a large gold standard chemical patent corpus. We developed annotation guidelines and selected 200 full patents from the World Intellectual Property Organization, United States Patent and Trademark Office, and European Patent Office. The patents were pre-annotated automatically and made available to four independent annotator groups each consisting of two to ten annotators. The annotators marked chemicals in different subclasses, diseases, targets, and modes of action. Spelling mistakes and spurious line break due to optical character recognition errors were also annotated. A subset of 47 patents was annotated by at least three annotator groups, from which harmonized annotations and inter-annotator agreement scores were derived. One group annotated the full set. The patent corpus includes 400,125 annotations for the full set and 36,537 annotations for the harmonized set. All patents and annotated entities are publicly available at www.biosemantics.org."
534,"CT-Based Attenuation Correction in I-123-Ioflupane SPECT."
535,"PURPOSE: Attenuation correction (AC) based on low-dose computed tomography (CT) could be more accurate in brain single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) than the widely used Chang method, and, therefore, has the potential to improve both semi-quantitative analysis and visual image interpretation. The present study evaluated CT-based AC for dopamine transporter SPECT with I-123-ioflupane. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Sixty-two consecutive patients in whom I-123-ioflupane SPECT including low-dose CT had been performed were recruited retrospectively at 3 centres. For each patient, 3 different SPECT images were reconstructed: without AC, with Chang AC and with CT-based AC. Distribution volume ratio (DVR) images were obtained by scaling voxel intensities using the whole brain without striata as reference. For assessing the impact of AC on semi-quantitative analysis, specific-to-background ratios (SBR) in caudate and putamen were obtained by fully automated SPM8-based region of interest (ROI) analysis and tested for their diagnostic power using receiver-operator-characteristic (ROC) analysis. For assessing the impact of AC on visual image reading, screenshots of stereotactically normalized DVR images presented in randomized order were interpreted independently by two raters at each centre. RESULTS: CT-based AC resulted in intermediate SBRs about half way between no AC and Chang. Maximum area under the ROC curve was achieved by the putamen SBR, with negligible impact of AC (0.924, 0.935 and 0.938 for no, CT-based and Chang AC). Diagnostic accuracy of visual interpretation also did not depend on AC. CONCLUSIONS: The impact of CT-based versus Chang AC on the interpretation of I-123-ioflupane SPECT is negligible. Therefore, CT-based AC cannot be recommended for routine use in clinical patient care, not least because of the additional radiation exposure."
536,"[State of the art treatment of progressive or refractory multiple myeloma.]"
537,"Multiple myeloma (MM) is with an incidence of 4-6/100 000 inhabitants a fairly frequent malignancy of B cells. The incidence increases markedly with age. In this review changes in the treatment of relapsed / refractory myeloma during the last decade have been analysed. The present standard of care in the progressive or refractory myeloma was elaborated by the working group ""Refractory Multiple Myeloma"" using an extensive literature search for studies published between 2003 and 2013. Outside of clinical trials, high-dose therapy with stem cell transplantation is recommended in fit patients up to 75 years without significant comorbidities. Ongoing studies address the question about the least toxic and the most effective treatment. Therefore, inclusion of patients in therapeutic trials and use of novel agent combinations is highly recommended, e. g. with 3rd generation-IMIDs (pomalidomide), new proteasome inhibitors, such as carfilzomib, ixazomib or oprozomib, antibodies, such as elotuzumab, daratumumab or SAR650984, siltuximab, tabalumab, denosumab, romosozumab, BTK-, HSP-inhibitors and other innovative phase I/II agents. Conclusion: Based on new insights in the pathogenesis of the disease, treatment options for MM have changed significantly in recent years. There is a significantly larger treatment diversity, i. e. more MM-active agents and combinations are available today. Even with relapsed MM, patients with the disease often live longer and have fewer complications."
538,"[Symptomatic therapy of SIADH in small cell lung cancer by tolvaptan.]"
539,"History and clinical findings: A 69-year-old woman with small cell lung cancer presented in the emergency ward because of severe back pain. She had received tolvaptan treatment in hospital for paraneoplastic SIADH but had discontinued the drug after discharge from hospital 3 days ago. Restriction of fluid intake was not tolerated. Investigations: Consistent with SIADH, there were profound hyponatraemia, elevated urine osmolality and urine sodium. Treatment and course: After a generalized seizure triggered by hyponatraemia, tolvaptan was reintroduced in addition to radiochemotherapy. Serum sodium concentration increased and finally returned to normal. Conclusion: If restriction of fluid intake is not tolerated by the patients the vasopressin antagonist tolvaptan provides an alternative symptomatic treatment of paraneoplastic SIADH."
540,"Serum Concentrations of Prostate-Specific Antigen Measured Using Immune Extraction, Trypsin Digestion, and Tandem Mass Spectrometry Quantification of LSEPAELTDAVK Peptide."
541,"Context.-Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) is a 34-kDa glycoprotein with chymotrypsin-like enzyme activity that circulates both in free forms and complexed to various enzyme inhibitors including antichymotrypsin and alpha2-macroglobulin. Prostate-specific antigen bound to alpha2-macroglobulin is not detected by commercial PSA immunoassays. Objective.-To develop a mass spectrometry assay that detects the same forms of PSA as the immunoassays, which could serve as a reference for harmonizing PSA immunoassays. Design.-Prostate-specific antigen was immune extracted from serum, trypsin was digested, and the LSEPAELTDAVK peptide was quantitated on an API 5000 spectrometer. Calibrators were made by adding 10% free and 90% antichymotrypsin-bound PSA to female sera. The assay was standardized to the World Health Organization 96/670 reference standard. Validation of clinical utility and comparisons with 2 immunoassays (Roche cobas and Beckman Access) were performed using frozen sera aliquots from 100 men undergoing prostate biopsy (50 negative, 50 with cancer) and 5 serial samples collected over time from 5 men with advanced prostate cancer. Results.-The antibody extraction efficiency was greater than 99%. The assay has an analytic range from 1.2 to 76 ng/mL, with precision ranging from 8.6% at 1.5 ng/mL to 5.4% at 27 ng/mL. The mass spectrometry assay correlated well with 2 immunoassays. All 3 assays showed statistically equivalent separation of prostate cancer from benign disease using receiver operating characteristic curve analysis. Conclusions.-This mass spectrometry assay can reliably measure PSA concentrations in human serum and could serve as a reference standard for harmonizing PSA immunoassays."
542,"Proximal Tubulopathies Associated With Monoclonal Light Chains: The Spectrum of Clinicopathologic Manifestations and Molecular Pathogenesis."
543,"Context.-Lesions associated with monoclonal light and heavy chains display a variety of glomerular, tubular interstitial, and vascular manifestations. While some of the entities are well recognized, including light and heavy chain deposition diseases, AL (light chain) and AH (heavy chain) amyloidosis, and light chain (""myeloma"") cast nephropathy, other lesions centered on proximal tubules are much less accurately identified, properly diagnosed, and adequately understood in terms of pathogenesis and molecular mechanisms involved. These proximal tubule-centered lesions are typically associated with monoclonal light chains and have not been reported in patients with circulating monoclonal heavy chains. Objective.-To determine the incidence of proximal tubulopathies in a series of patients with monoclonal light chain-related renal lesions and characterize them with an emphasis on clinical correlations and elucidation of molecular mechanisms involved in their pathogenesis. Design.-A study of 5410 renal biopsies with careful evaluation of light microscopic, immunofluorescence, and electron microscopic findings was conducted to identify these monoclonal light/heavy chain-related lesions. In selected cases, ultrastructural immunolabeling was performed to better illustrate and understand molecular mechanisms involved or to resolve specific diagnostic difficulties. Results.-In all, 2.5% of the biopsies were diagnosed as demonstrating renal pathology associated with monoclonal light or heavy chains. Of these, approximately 46% were classified as proximal tubule-centered lesions, also referred to as monoclonal light chain-associated proximal tubulopathies. These proximal tubulopathies were divided into 4 groups defined by characteristic immunomorphologic manifestations associated with specific clinical settings. Conclusions.-These are important lesions whose recognition in the different clinical settings is extremely important for patients' clinical management, therapeutic purposes, and prognosis. These entities have been segregated into 4 distinct variants, conceptualized morphologically and clinically. Specific mechanisms involved in their pathogenesis are proposed."
544,"Langerhans Cell Histiocytosis Involving the Gastrointestinal Tract."
545,"Langerhans cell histiocytosis is a rare disease with a variable clinical presentation, and its prognosis and treatment depend on the extent and severity of disease. Although the pathogenesis of Langerhans cell histiocytosis has been debated in the past, recent evidence suggests that it is a neoplastic proliferation potentially derived from a myeloid-lineage precursor. Involvement of the gastrointestinal tract in Langerhans cell histiocytosis is exceedingly rare and is most often encountered in the pediatric population, in the setting of systemic disease. This is illustrated using a case of Langerhans cell histiocytosis involving the esophagus in a 59-year-old woman who presented with dysphagia, in which molecular testing documented a BRAF V600E mutation. We review the features and implications of this diagnosis."
546,"Lobular Neoplasia: Morphology and Management."
547,"Context.-Lobular neoplasia encompasses a spectrum of disease, including atypical lobular hyperplasia and lobular carcinoma in situ. Although classic forms of lobular neoplasia are predominantly heralded as a risk marker, the pleomorphic form of lobular carcinoma in situ is generally regarded as a more aggressive subtype and a possible cancer precursor, and thus is treated in a manner more similar to ductal carcinoma in situ than classic forms of lobular neoplasia. Objective.-To focus on the morphologic spectrum of lobular neoplasia as highlighted by 3 cases and current management recommendations. Areas of diagnostic challenge and controversy are addressed. Data Sources.-A review of the pertinent published literature and current national guidelines was conducted. Conclusions.-Correct classification of classic lobular neoplasia and pleomorphic lobular carcinoma in situ is critical because of differences in clinical management, with current treatment strategies focused on risk reduction for patients with classic lobular neoplasia and eradication of the lesion for those with pleomorphic lobular carcinoma in situ."
548,"Neutrophilic Panniculitis: Algorithmic Approach to a Heterogeneous Group of Disorders."
549,"Context.-Neutrophilic panniculitis encompasses an etiologically and morphologically heterogeneous group of disorders. Correct histopathologic diagnosis is important in identifying certain systemic diseases and guiding appropriate treatment. Objective.-To review the clinical and histopathologic features of different types of neutrophilic panniculitis, and to provide a diagnostic algorithm for these disorders. Data Sources.-A review of the literature with emphasis on the distinguishing features of different entities was performed. Conclusions.-Evaluation for neutrophilic panniculitis entails paying close attention to the pattern of inflammation, the type of fat necrosis present, any evidence of vascular damage, and other relevant histopathologic features. An algorithmic approach integrating all histopathologic, clinical, and laboratory findings is required for correct diagnosis."
550,"Clear Cell Melanoma: A Cutaneous Clear Cell Malignancy."
551,"Clear cell melanoma is a rare clear cell malignancy. Accurate diagnosis of clear cell melanoma requires integration of immunohistochemical and morphologic findings, with molecular studies to rule out clear cell sarcoma. The differential diagnosis includes melanoma, carcinoma, perivascular epithelioid cell tumor, and epidermotropic clear cell sarcoma. We use a case of a lesion on the helix of an 86-year-old man as an example. Histologic examination revealed an ulcerated clear cell malignant tumor. Tumor cell cytoplasm contained periodic acid-Schiff-positive, diastase-sensitive glycogen. Tumor cells showed positive labeling for S100, HMB-45, and Melan-A, and negative labeling for cytokeratins, p63, and smooth muscle actin. Molecular studies demonstrated BRAF V600E mutation, copy gains at the 6p25 (RREB1) and 11q13 (CCND1) loci, and absence of EWSR1-ATF1 fusion. These findings supported a diagnosis of clear cell melanoma. The rare pure clear cell morphology occurs due to accumulation of intracytoplasmic glycogen. We review the differential diagnosis of clear cell melanoma and describe the utility of immunohistochemical and molecular studies in confirming this diagnosis."
552,"Selected Inflammatory Imitators of Mycosis Fungoides: Histologic Features and Utility of Ancillary Studies."
553,"Mycosis fungoides is the most common primary cutaneous lymphoma; however, it remains a significant diagnostic challenge, in part because of the overlap with several inflammatory dermatoses. Despite advances in immunohistochemistry and molecular diagnostics, false-positive, false-negative, and indeterminate diagnoses are not uncommon. In most cases, the overall balance of morphologic, immunophenotypic, and genetic features must be considered carefully because there are few sensitive and specific clues to the diagnosis. Moreover, an appropriate clinical presentation is essential to the diagnosis and helps to favor or exclude inflammatory/reactive processes. Herein, we discuss 3 important inflammatory dermatoses that may closely simulate mycosis fungoides, and we review the use of ancillary studies in these challenging cases."
554,"Controversies and Considerations in the Diagnosis of Primary Cutaneous CD4 Small/Medium T-Cell Lymphoma."
555,"Context.-Primary cutaneous CD4+ small/medium T-cell lymphoma is a provisional and controversial entity with a broad differential diagnosis. Despite being an uncommon lymphoma, it is a frequent diagnostic consideration in cutaneous biopsies with a dense lymphoid infiltrate because it shows overlapping features with reactive lymphoid hyperplasia (pseudolymphoma) and a variety of other primary cutaneous and systemic lymphomas. However, proper classification of this process is important for determining patient prognosis and treatment options. Objective.-To review the clinical, morphologic, immunophenotypic, and genetic features of primary cutaneous CD4+ small/medium T-cell lymphoma and contrast those features with entities in the differential diagnosis. Data Sources.-Applicable literature will be reviewed with emphasis on current controversies and distinguishing characteristics. Conclusions.-Although many consider primary cutaneous CD4+ small/medium T-cell lymphoma to be indistinguishable from reactive lymphoid hyperplasia/pseudolymphoma, it can be differentiated from other primary cutaneous and systemic lymphomas. Patients with solitary lesions of primary cutaneous CD4+ small/medium T-cell lymphoma generally have an excellent prognosis. Nevertheless, a subset of patients who have been reported to meet criteria for this lymphoma have followed a more-aggressive course; however, those patients show some differing clinical, morphologic, and immunophenotypic features."
556,"Transient Abnormal Myelopoiesis in Neonates: GATA Get the Diagnosis."
557,"Transient abnormal myelopoiesis occurs exclusively in patients with Down syndrome (constitutional trisomy 21), manifests in the neonatal period, and is characterized by circulating megakaryoblasts with varied degrees of multisystem organ involvement. In most cases, this process resolves spontaneously by 3 to 6 months of age, but for some, the disease can be fatal. Affected patients are particularly prone to develop acute megakaryoblastic leukemia in early childhood. Somatic GATA1 mutations are believed to be pivotal in the development of transient abnormal myelopoiesis and have proven to be a marker of clonal identity in its evolution to megakaryoblastic leukemia. We describe a study case of transient abnormal myelopoiesis and review the clinical manifestations, laboratory features, natural history, molecular genetics, and postulated disease pathogenesis of this disorder."
558,"Diagnosis of Splenic B-Cell Lymphomas in the Bone Marrow: A Review of Histopathologic, Immunophenotypic, and Genetic Findings."
559,"Splenic B-cell lymphomas are a heterogeneous group of diseases comprising several entities that exhibit overlapping features. Diagnosis of these lymphomas has been reliant on the histopathologic examination of the spleen. However, with advances in diagnostic modalities and therapy, splenectomy is not commonly performed, and diagnosis and subclassification must be rendered based on the blood and bone marrow findings. In this brief review, we summarize the morphologic, immunophenotypic, and genetic findings of splenic B-cell lymphomas in the blood and bone marrow."
560,"Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma of the Prostate."
561,"In this article, we review prostatic lymphomas and discuss the differential diagnosis of high-grade malignant neoplasms of the prostate. We illustrate this with a case of a 46-year-old man seen with lower urinary tract obstruction who had diffuse involvement by a high-grade malignancy on prostate biopsy. Morphologic evaluation and immunohistochemistry were consistent with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma of the prostate. Workup with positron emission tomography-computed tomography demonstrated intensely hypermetabolic lymph nodes in the mediastinum, as well as widespread osseous involvement and involvement of the pancreatic tail, prostate, and urinary bladder, suggesting secondary prostatic involvement by a nodal lymphoma. Lymphomas of the prostate are uncommon in surgical pathology practice and usually represent secondary involvement from leukemia/lymphoma at a more typical site. Chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma is the most common subtype."
562,"Diagnosis of Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma on Fine-Needle Aspiration Cytology."
563,"Fine-needle aspiration has assumed an increasingly important role in the diagnosis and management of patients with advanced stage cancer. Given its predilection for metastases to distant sites and organs at the time of presentation, metastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is not infrequently encountered in the setting of fine-needle aspiration for initial diagnosis. In some instances, fine-needle aspiration may be the only opportunity to obtain diagnostic tissue to diagnose and subclassify RCC. Therefore, cytopathologists and cytotechnologists should be familiar with and recognize the cytomorphology of RCC and the ancillary studies that can be used to confirm and subclassify RCC. Herein, we describe a case of metastatic RCC initially diagnosed on fine-needle aspiration, discuss the cytomorphologic features of RCC subtypes, and review pertinent ancillary immunohistochemical and cytogenetic adjuncts."
564,"Inflammatory Myofibroblastic Tumor of the Bladder."
565,"We illustrate a case of an inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor (IMT) involving the bladder in a woman with dysuria and review the literature and differential diagnosis. Inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor, also referred to as pseudosarcomatous myofibroblastic proliferation, is a rare lesion that can arise in the genitourinary system and is characterized by a fascicular arrangement of myofibroblasts with admixed inflammatory cells and slitlike vessels. Urinary bladder IMT can be a diagnostic pitfall because its histologic features (brisk mitoses, invasion into muscularis propria, and prominent nucleoli) can mimic malignancy. The differential diagnosis of urinary bladder IMT includes sarcomatoid carcinoma and leiomyosarcoma. Diagnostic features such as bland nuclear chromatin, ganglion-like cells, pale eosinophilic cytoplasm with long processes, overexpression of anaplastic lymphoma kinase (immunohistochemistry or gene rearrangement studies), and the absence of atypical mitoses help distinguish IMT from its malignant mimics. Current controversies regarding postoperative spindle cell nodule and IMT are discussed."
566,"Pseudocarcinomatous Hyperplasia of the Urinary Bladder."
567,"We review the morphology and differential diagnoses of pseudocarcinomatous hyperplasia of the bladder, using a study case to illustrate the discussion. Pseudocarcinomatous hyperplasia is a rare, reactive response to an ischemic insult, classically to radiation therapy, and consists of proliferative, pseudoinfiltrative urothelial nests within the stroma. The presence of background radiation therapy-related changes, such as numerous dilated thrombosed vessels, reactive-appearing endothelial and stromal cells, edema, and hemorrhage, can provide clues to the diagnosis. The main differential diagnoses include invasive urothelial carcinoma and the nested variant of urothelial carcinoma; morphologic features, such as the presence or absence of background therapy-related changes and the architecture and the cytologic atypia of the nests, can help distinguish between pseudocarcinomatous hyperplasia and urothelial carcinoma."
568,"Correlation of Proteinuria with Podocyte Foot Process Effacement in IgA Nephropathy: An Ultrastructural Study."
569,"Abstract Background: Proteinuria is an uncommon clinical manifestation of IgA nephropathy and is usually seen in cases with severe lesions like endocapillary proliferation. However, it is occasionally seen even with cases with mild glomerular manifestations and may even be of nephrotic range. Predictor: Podocyte foot process effacement. Outcome: Severity of proteinuria. Measurements: Podocyte foot process effacement was measured. Morphometric analysis was performed on transmission electron microscope images using a computerized digital photomicrograph system (BioWizard 4.2 Image analysis software, New Delhi, India). Proteinuria was measured quantitatively assigned into five grades. Results: It was found that as the extent of proteinuria increased, the effacement ratio also increased, and this was most significant between ""no"" proteinuria and the rest of the categories. Conclusion: Nephrotic presentation in IgA nephropathy is a known phenomenon and in certain cases may show near normal glomerular morphology with severe foot process effacement on EM being the only significant finding to explain the proteinuria. Proteinuria in these cases shows a significant correlation with degree of foot process effacement. Renal biopsy is important in these cases because they are known to have a better prognosis and are usually steroid responsive."
570,"Features of the biotechnologically relevant polyamide family ""cyanophycins"" and their biosynthesis in prokaryotes and eukaryotes."
571,"Abstract Cyanophycin, inclusions in cyanobacteria discovered by the Italian scientist Borzi in 1887, were characterized as a polyamide consisting of aspartic acid and arginine. Its synthesis in cyanobacteria was analyzed regarding growth conditions, responsible gene product, requirements, polymer structure and properties. Heterologous expression of diverse cyanophycin synthetases (CphA) in Escherichia coli enabled further enzyme characterization. Cyanophycin is a polyamide with variable composition and physiochemical properties dependent on host and cultivation conditions in contrast to the extracellular polyamides poly-gamma-glutamic acid and poly--l-lysine. Furthermore, recombinant prokaryotes and transgenic eukaryotes, including plants expressing different cphA genes, were characterized as suitable for production of insoluble cyanophycin regarding higher yields and modified composition for other requirements and applications. In addition, cyanophycin was characterized as a source for the synthesis of polyaspartic acid or N-containing bulk chemicals and dipeptides upon chemical treatment or degradation by cyanophycinases, respectively. Moreover, water-soluble cyanophycin derivatives with altered amino acid composition were isolated from transgenic plants, yeasts and recombinant bacteria. Thereby, the range of dipeptides could be extended by biological processes and by chemical modification, thus increasing the range of applications for cyanophycin and its dipeptides, including agriculture, food supplementations, medical and cosmetic purposes, synthesis of the polyacrylate substitute poly(aspartic acid) and other applications."
572,"Trends in the resistance profiles of Acinetobacter baumannii endemic clones in a university hospital of Argentina."
573,"A total of 925 Acinetobacter spp. isolates were collected from routine clinical samples of patients admitted to the university hospital of Buenos Aires city during the period 2004-2012. From this collection, 129 isolates identified as Acinetobacter baumannii were selected for molecular studies. Minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of antimicrobials were determined by agar dilution method. Colistin (COL) heteroresistance was investigated by means of population analysis studies. PCR-based methods were used for epidemiological analysis and for the screening of carbapenemases and the blatetB gene. We have observed a steady rise in the MIC50 of imipenem (IMI)-resistant isolates and an increment in the presence of blaOXA-23-like gene (74-100%) as well. A rapid increasing rate of minocycline (MIN) resistance and a rise of the MIC50 of the resistant isolates have been detected since the year 2008. All isolates harboured the tet (B) gene. An increase in the value of the tigecycline (TIG) MIC was seen from the year 2007 onwards. This loss of activity was observed among different clones. A rise of COL heteroresistance from 46.4% in 2004 to 95% in 2012 was detected. During this period, COL consumption also increased (11.1-fold). However, COL resistance remained sporadic."
574,"A Growth Factor-Induced, Spatially Organizing Cytoskeletal Module Enables Rapid and Persistent Fibroblast Migration."
575,"Directional migration requires robust front/back polarity. We find that fibroblasts treated with platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) and prepolarized by plating on a fibronectin line substrate exhibit persistent migration for hours. This does not occur in the absence of PDGF or on uniformly coated fibronectin substrates. Persistent migration arises from establishment of two functional modules at cell front and back. At the front, formation of a zone containing podosome-like structures (PLS) dynamically correlates with low RhoA and myosin activity and absence of a contractile lamella. At the back, myosin contractility specifically controls tail retraction with minimal crosstalk to the front module. The PLS zone is maintained in a dynamic steady state that preserves size and position relative to the cell front, allowing for long-term coordination of front and back modules. We propose that front/back uncoupling achieved by the PLS zone is crucial for persistent migration in the absence of directional cues."
576,"How Kinetochores CCAN Resist Force."
577,"Kinetochores orchestrate chromosome segregation during mitosis and must cope with dynamic forces generated by attached microtubules. In this issue of Developmental Cell, Suzuki et al. (2014) demonstrate that the constitutive centromere-associated network (CCAN) displays a complex architecture that plays a crucial role in resisting these forces."
578,"Diabetic pregnancy: an overview of current guidelines and clinical practice."
579,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: We review the recent changes in diagnostic criteria of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), describe problems with maintaining and monitoring adequate blood glucose, especially in type 1 diabetes, and provide a brief overview of the currently approved glucose-lowering therapies in pregnancy. RECENT FINDINGS: After the Hyperglycemia and Adverse Pregnancy Outcomes (HAPO) study, the definition of GDM was revised under the auspices of the International Association of Diabetes and Pregnancy Study Groups. The guidelines, with minor modifications, were endorsed by WHO in 2013. Intensive debate continues, focused on the expected large increase in prevalence of GDM and shortage of experimental evidence of clinical benefits from the new diagnostic criteria. Despite a very good glycaemic control, the prevalence of macrosomia remains high. This indicates a serious deficiency in current monitoring tools and the available therapies. So far, the only glucose-lowering medications approved for use during pregnancy are insulins. SUMMARY: The HAPO study provides a very suggestive evidence for a strong, continuous association of maternal glucose levels with an increased risk of excessive foetal weight gain. The new definition of GDM results in higher healthcare expenditure, but remains cost-effective. The current therapeutic goals require careful revision to further reduce the risk of adverse outcomes. New glucose-monitoring strategies and markers, and approval of new pharmacotherapies are needed."
580,"STAT3: A Novel Molecular Mediator of Resistance to Chemoradiotherapy."
581,"Chemoradiotherapy (CRT) represents a standard treatment for many human cancers, frequently combined with radical surgical resection. However, a considerable percentage of primary cancers are at least partially resistant to CRT, which represents a substantial clinical problem, because it exposes cancer patients to the potential side effects of both irradiation and chemotherapy. It is therefore exceedingly important to determine the molecular characteristics underlying CRT-resistance and to identify novel molecular targets that can be manipulated to re-sensitize resistant tumors to CRT. In this review, we highlight much of the recent evidence suggesting that the signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) plays a prominent role in mediating CRT-resistance, and we outline why inhibition of STAT3 holds great promise for future multimodal treatment concepts in oncology."
582,"The Future of Glioblastoma Therapy: Synergism of Standard of Care and Immunotherapy."
583,"The current standard of care for glioblastoma (GBM) is maximal surgical resection with adjuvant radiotherapy and temozolomide (TMZ). As the 5-year survival with GBM remains at a dismal <10%, novel therapies are needed. Immunotherapies such as the dendritic cell (DC) vaccine, heat shock protein vaccines, and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFRvIII) vaccines have shown encouraging results in clinical trials, and have demonstrated synergistic effects with conventional therapeutics resulting in ongoing phase III trials. Chemoradiation has been shown to have synergistic effects when used in combination with immunotherapy. Cytotoxic ionizing radiation is known to trigger pro-inflammatory signaling cascades and immune activation secondary to cell death, which can then be exploited by immunotherapies. The future of GBM therapeutics will involve finding the place for immunotherapy in the current treatment regimen with a focus on developing strategies. Here, we review current GBM therapy and the evidence for combination of immune checkpoint inhibitors, DC and peptide vaccines with the current standard of care."
584,"Repositioning of Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitors as Antagonists of ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters in Anticancer Drug Resistance."
585,"The phenomenon of multidrug resistance (MDR) has attenuated the efficacy of anticancer drugs and the possibility of successful cancer chemotherapy. ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters play an essential role in mediating MDR in cancer cells by increasing efflux of drugs from cancer cells, hence reducing the intracellular accumulation of chemotherapeutic drugs. Interestingly, small-molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), such as AST1306, lapatinib, linsitinib, masitinib, motesanib, nilotinib, telatinib and WHI-P154, have been found to have the capability to overcome anticancer drug resistance by inhibiting ABC transporters in recent years. This review will focus on some of the latest and clinical developments with ABC transporters, TKIs and anticancer drug resistance."
586,"SUMO and KSHV Replication."
587,"Small Ubiquitin-related MOdifier (SUMO) modification was initially identified as a reversible post-translational modification that affects the regulation of diverse cellular processes, including signal transduction, protein trafficking, chromosome segregation, and DNA repair. Increasing evidence suggests that the SUMO system also plays an important role in regulating chromatin organization and transcription. It is thus not surprising that double-stranded DNA viruses, such as Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV), have exploited SUMO modification as a means of modulating viral chromatin remodeling during the latent-lytic switch. In addition, SUMO regulation allows the disassembly and assembly of promyelocytic leukemia protein-nuclear bodies (PML-NBs), an intrinsic antiviral host defense, during the viral replication cycle. Overcoming PML-NB-mediated cellular intrinsic immunity is essential to allow the initial transcription and replication of the herpesvirus genome after de novo infection. As a consequence, KSHV has evolved a way as to produce multiple SUMO regulatory viral proteins to modulate the cellular SUMO environment in a dynamic way during its life cycle. Remarkably, KSHV encodes one gene product (K-bZIP) with SUMO-ligase activities and one gene product (K-Rta) that exhibits SUMO-targeting ubiquitin ligase (STUbL) activity. In addition, at least two viral products are sumoylated that have functional importance. Furthermore, sumoylation can be modulated by other viral gene products, such as the viral protein kinase Orf36. Interference with the sumoylation of specific viral targets represents a potential therapeutic strategy when treating KSHV, as well as other oncogenic herpesviruses. Here, we summarize the different ways KSHV exploits and manipulates the cellular SUMO system and explore the multi-faceted functions of SUMO during KSHV's life cycle and pathogenesis."
588,"Positron Emission Tomography (PET) in Oncology."
589,"Since its introduction in the early nineties as a promising functional imaging technique in the management of neoplastic disorders, FDG-PET, and subsequently FDG-PET/CT, has become a cornerstone in several oncologic procedures such as tumor staging and restaging, treatment efficacy assessment during or after treatment end and radiotherapy planning. Moreover, the continuous technological progress of image generation and the introduction of sophisticated software to use PET scan as a biomarker paved the way to calculate new prognostic markers such as the metabolic tumor volume (MTV) and the total amount of tumor glycolysis (TLG). FDG-PET/CT proved more sensitive than contrast-enhanced CT scan in staging of several type of lymphoma or in detecting widespread tumor dissemination in several solid cancers, such as breast, lung, colon, ovary and head and neck carcinoma. As a consequence the stage of patients was upgraded, with a change of treatment in 10%-15% of them. One of the most evident advantages of FDG-PET was its ability to detect, very early during treatment, significant changes in glucose metabolism or even complete shutoff of the neoplastic cell metabolism as a surrogate of tumor chemosensitivity assessment. This could enable clinicians to detect much earlier the effectiveness of a given antineoplastic treatment, as compared to the traditional radiological detection of tumor shrinkage, which usually takes time and occurs much later."
590,"Off-Label Prescription of Genetically Modified Organism Medicines in Europe: Emerging Conflicts of Interest?"
591,"Abstract Recently, the first human medicine containing a genetically modified organism (GMO medicine) was authorized for use in the European market. Just as any medicinal product, the market authorization for a GMO medicine contains a precise description of the therapeutic use for which the medicinal product is intended. Within this use, the application of the GMO medicine is permitted, without the need for the institution to obtain a specific permit. In practice, however, medicinal products are also frequently prescribed for treatment outside the registered therapeutic use, a practice that is referred to as ""off-label use."" While off-label use of conventional medicines is permitted and has been very useful, the off-label use of GMO medicines is not covered in the European Union (EU) legislation or guidelines and falls under each member state's national environmental legislation. This implies that in the Netherlands and most other EU member states, an environmental permit will be required for any institution that uses the GMO medicine outside the registered application(s). In the Netherlands, this permit is identical to the permits required for the execution of clinical trials involving nonregistered GMOs. The application procedure for such permit is time-consuming. This process can therefore limit the therapeutic options for medical professionals. As a consequence, desired treatment regimens could be withheld for certain patient (groups). To make future off-label use of GMO medicines permissible in a way that is acceptable for all stakeholders, regulators should adopt a proactive attitude and formulate transparent legislative procedures for this. Only then the field can maintain the public acceptance of GMO medicines, while maintaining the freedom to operate of medical professionals."
592,"Standing on the Shoulders of Pinel, Freud, and Kraepelin: A Historiometric Inquiry Into the Histories of Psychiatry."
593,"History of psychiatry can provide us with a map of the evolution of the practice and identify its major figures. A historiometric approach was taken to available history of psychiatry texts and a historical dictionary. Reliability was tested against data from the journal History of Psychiatry. Those cited in all historical accounts are characterized as major figures, whereas those cited in at least 60% of the sources are considered significant figures. An index of eminence is calculated for each significant figure. The Cronbach's alpha was 0.89. Seventy-four significant figures were identified, of which 18 are considered major figures. Among these, Freud, Pinel, and Kraepelin have the highest eminence-in that order. Pinel, Freud, and Kraepelin represent key moments in three epochs in the history of psychiatry: the asylum era, the first biological psychiatry, and the psychoanalytical period, respectively. The most recent historical periods are not well represented in histories of psychiatry."
594,"Differences Between Patients With Schizophrenia With and Without Co-Occurring Methamphetamine Use Disorders in a Taiwanese Public Psychiatric Hospital."
595,"This study aimed to examine the factors related to and the outcomes of schizophrenic patients with co-occurring methamphetamine use disorders (MUDs). All schizophrenic patients discharged from a psychiatric hospital between January 1, 2006, and December 31, 2006, were monitored. This study compared the important demographic and clinical variables between patients with co-occurring MUDs and those without, and postdischarge measured time to rehospitalization during a 1-year period. Seven hundred fifty-six patients were included in this study. Of these patients, 88 (11.6%) reported the use of methamphetamine. Univariate analyses indicated that male sex, low educational level, discharge against medical advice, missed first appointment after discharge, co-occurring other illicit substance use disorder, age (younger), diazepam equivalents prescribed at discharge (higher), number of previous admissions within the past 5 years (higher), and length of hospital stay (longer) were predictive of patients with co-occurring MUDs. There were also significant differences in time to rehospitalization between these two groups during the follow-up periods. Many factors can be identified in schizophrenic patients with co-occurring MUDs. Furthermore, schizophrenic patients with co-occurring MUDs were more likely to be rehospitalized. Future studies in many different mental health systems are needed before these findings can be generalized."
596,"Is Ankle Contracture After Stroke Due to Abnormal Intermuscular Force Transmission?"
597,"Contracture after stroke could be due to abnormal mechanical interactions between muscles. This study examined if ankle plantarflexor muscle contracture after stroke is due to abnormal force transmission between gastrocnemius and soleus muscles. Muscle fascicle lengths were measured from ultrasound images of soleus in 5 subjects with stroke and ankle contracture and 6 able-bodied subjects. Changes in soleus fascicle length or pennation during passive knee extension at fixed ankle angle were assumed to indicate intermuscular force transmission. Changes in soleus fascicle length or pennation were adjusted for changes in ankle motion. Subjects with stroke had significant ankle contracture. After adjustment for ankle motion, 9 of 11 subjects demonstrated small changes in soleus fascicle length with knee extension, suggestive of intermuscular force transmission. However the small changes in fascicle length may have been artifact caused by movement of the ultrasound transducers. There were no systematic differences in change in fascicle length (median between-group difference adjusting for ankle motion = -0.01, 95%CI -0.26 to 0.08 mm/degree of knee extension) or pennation (-0.05, 95%CI -0.15 to 0.07 degree/degree of knee extension). This suggests ankle contractures after stroke were not due to abnormal (systematically increased or decreased) intermuscular force transmission between gastrocnemius and soleus."
598,"Visualization of different characteristics of cerebrospinal fluid with acute encephalopathy and febrile seizures using pattern recognition analysis of H NMR."
599,"Background:In acute encephalopathy, deterioration of the condition can be rapid and early intervention is essential to prevent progression of the disease. However, in the acute period, differentiating acute encephalopathy from febrile seizures is difficult. Thus, an early diagnostic marker has been sought to enable early intervention. Proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1H NMR) spectroscopy is used to study the chemical characteristics of biological fluids such as cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). The purpose of this study was to ascertain if pattern recognition of 1H NMR spectra could differentiate CSF obtained from patients with acute encephalopathy and febrile seizures.Methods:CSF was obtained from patients with acute encephalopathy (n = 4), complex febrile seizures (n = 9) and simple febrile seizures (n = 9).Results:NMR spectra of CSF did not visually differ across the three groups. Spectral data were analyzed by partial least squares discriminant analysis and visualized by plotting the partial least squares scores of each sample. The three patient groups clustered separately on the plots.Conclusion:In this preliminary study, we were able to visualize different characteristics of CSF obtained from patients with acute encephalopathy and simple and complex febrile seizures using pattern recognition analysis of 1H NMR data.Pediatric Research (2014); doi:10.1038/pr.2014.141."
600,"Dosing in neonates: Special considerations in physiology and trial design."
601,"Determining the right dose for drugs used to treat neonates is critically important. Neonates have significant differences in physiology affecting drug absorption, distribution, metabolism, and elimination that makes extrapolating dosages from adults and older children inappropriate. In spite of recent legislative efforts requiring drug studies in this population, most drugs given to neonates remain insufficiently studied. Many ethical and logistical concerns make designing studies in this age group difficult. Fortunately, specialized analytical techniques, such as the use of dried blood spots, scavenged sampling, population pharmacokinetics analyses, and sparse sampling, have helped investigators better define doses that maximize efficacy and safety. Through the use of these methods, successful clinical trials have resulted in recent changes to drug dosing in this population.Pediatric Research (2014); doi:10.1038/pr.2014.143."
602,"Diabetes-associated changes in the fetal insulin/insulin-like growth factor system are organ specific in rats."
603,"Background:Diabetes in pregnancy affects fetal growth and development. The insulin/IGF system comprising insulin, insulin-like growth factors, their receptors and binding proteins, has been implicated in fetal growth regulation. This study tested the hypothesis that maternal diabetes alters the fetal insulin/IGF system in a tissue specific manner.Methods:Wistar rats were rendered diabetic by neonatal administration of streptozotocin and mated with control rats. At day 21 of gestation the weights of fetuses, placentas and fetal organs (heart, lung, liver, stomach, intestine and pancreas) were determined. Maternal and fetal plasma concentrations of insulin, IGF1 and IGF2 were measured by ELISA, and expression of IGF1, IGF2, IGF1R, IGF2R, IR, IGFBP1, BP2 and BP3 in placenta and fetal organs by qPCR.Results:The well known increase in fetal growth in this model of mild diabetes is accompanied by elevated insulin and IGF1 levels and alterations of the insulin/IGF system in the fetus and the placenta. These alterations were organ and gene specific. The insulin/IGF system was generally upregulated, especially in the fetal heart, whilst it was downregulated in fetal lung.Conclusion:In our model of mild diabetes the effect of maternal diabetes on fetal weight and fetal insulin/IGF system expression is organ specific with highly sensitive organs such as lung and heart, and organs that were less affected, such as stomach.Pediatric Research (2014); doi:10.1038/pr.2014.139."
604,"Abnormal Calcium Handling and Exaggerated Cardiac Dysfunction in Mice with Defective Vitamin D Signaling."
605,"AIM: Altered vitamin D signaling is associated with cardiac dysfunction, but the pathogenic mechanism is not clearly understood. We examine the mechanism and the role of vitamin D signaling in the development of cardiac dysfunction. METHODS AND RESULTS: We analyzed 1alpha-hydroxylase (1alpha-OHase) knockout (1alpha-OHase-/-) mice, which lack 1alpha-OH enzymes that convert the inactive form to hormonally active form of vitamin D. 1alpha-OHase-/- mice showed modest cardiac hypertrophy at baseline. Induction of pressure overload by transverse aortic constriction (TAC) demonstrated exaggerated cardiac dysfunction in 1alpha-OHase-/- mice compared to their WT littermates with a significant increase in fibrosis and expression of inflammatory cytokines. Analysis of calcium (Ca2+) transient demonstrated profound Ca2+ handling abnormalities in 1alpha-OHase-/- mouse cardiomyocytes (CMs), and treatment with paricalcitol (PC), an activated vitamin D3 analog, significantly attenuated defective Ca2+ handling in 1alpha-OHase-/- CMs. We further delineated the effect of vitamin D deficiency condition to TAC by first correcting the vitamin D deficiency in 1alpha-OHase-/- mice, followed then by either a daily maintenance dose of vitamin D or vehicle (to achieve vitamin D deficiency) at the time of sham or TAC. In mice treated with vitamin D, there was a significant attenuation of TAC-induced cardiac hypertrophy, interstitial fibrosis, inflammatory markers, Ca2+ handling abnormalities and cardiac function compared to the vehicle treated animals. CONCLUSIONS: Our results provide insight into the mechanism of cardiac dysfunction, which is associated with severely defective Ca2+ handling and defective vitamin D signaling in 1alpha-OHase-/- mice."
606,"Whole Exome Analysis Identifies Frequent CNGA1 Mutations in Japanese Population with Autosomal Recessive Retinitis Pigmentosa."
607,"OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to investigate frequent disease-causing gene mutations in autosomal recessive retinitis pigmentosa (arRP) in the Japanese population. METHODS: In total, 99 Japanese patients with non-syndromic and unrelated arRP or sporadic RP (spRP) were recruited in this study and ophthalmic examinations were conducted for the diagnosis of RP. Among these patients, whole exome sequencing analysis of 30 RP patients and direct sequencing screening of all CNGA1 exons of the other 69 RP patients were performed. RESULTS: Whole exome sequencing of 30 arRP/spRP patients identified disease-causing gene mutations of CNGA1 (four patients), EYS (three patients) and SAG (one patient) in eight patients and potential disease-causing gene variants of USH2A (two patients), EYS (one patient), TULP1 (one patient) and C2orf71 (one patient) in five patients. Screening of an additional 69 arRP/spRP patients for the CNGA1 gene mutation revealed one patient with a homozygous mutation. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first identification of CNGA1 mutations in arRP Japanese patients. The frequency of CNGA1 gene mutation was 5.1% (5/99 patients). CNGA1 mutations are one of the most frequent arRP-causing mutations in Japanese patients."
608,"Aurora Kinases as Targets in Drug-Resistant Neuroblastoma Cells."
609,"Aurora kinase inhibitors displayed activity in pre-clinical neuroblastoma models. Here, we studied the effects of the pan-aurora kinase inhibitor tozasertib (VX680, MK-0457) and the aurora kinase inhibitor alisertib (MLN8237) that shows some specificity for aurora kinase A over aurora kinase B in a panel of neuroblastoma cell lines with acquired drug resistance. Both compounds displayed anti-neuroblastoma activity in the nanomolar range. The anti-neuroblastoma mechanism included inhibition of aurora kinase signalling as indicated by decreased phosphorylation of the aurora kinase substrate histone H3, cell cycle inhibition in G2/M phase, and induction of apoptosis. The activity of alisertib but not of tozasertib was affected by ABCB1 expression. Aurora kinase inhibitors induced a p53 response and their activity was enhanced in combination with the MDM2 inhibitor and p53 activator nutlin-3 in p53 wild-type cells. In conclusion, aurora kinases are potential drug targets in therapy-refractory neuroblastoma, in particular for the vast majority of p53 wild-type cases."
610,"Urotensin II Inhibits Doxorubicin-Induced Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cell Death by Modulating ATF Expression and via the ERK and Akt Pathway."
611,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Regulation of the homeostasis of vascular endothelium is critical for the processes of vascular remodeling and angiogenesis under physiological and pathological conditions. Urotensin II (U-II), a potent vasoactive peptide, participates in vascular and myocardial remodeling after injury. We investigated the protective effect of U-II on doxorubicin (DOX)-induced apoptosis in cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and the potential mechanisms involved in this process. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: Cultured HUVECs were treated with vehicle, DOX (1 microM), U-II, or U-II plus DOX. Apoptosis was evaluated by DNA strand break level with TdT-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL) staining. Western blot analysis was employed to determine the related protein expression and flow cytometry assay was used to determine the TUNEL positive cells. KEY RESULTS: U-II reduced the quantity of cleaved caspase-3 and cytosol cytochrome c and increased Bcl-2 expression, which results in protecting HUVECs from DOX-induced apoptosis. U-II induced Activating transcription factor 3 (ATF3) at both mRNA and protein levels in U-II-treated cells. Knockdown of ATF3 with ATF3 siRNA significantly reduced ATF3 protein levels and U-II protective effect under DOX-treated condition. U-II downregulated p53 expression in DOX-induced HUVECs apoptosis, and it rapidly activated extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase (ERK) and Akt. The DOX induced change of p53 was not affected by U-II antagonist (urantide) under ATF-3 knockdown. The inhibitory effect of U-II on DOX-increased apoptosis was attenuated by inhibitors of ERK (U0126) and PI3K/Akt (LY294002). CONCLUSION AND IMPLICATIONS: Our observations provide evidence that U-II protects HUVECs from DOX-induced apoptosis. ERK-Akt phosphorylation, ATF3 activation, and p53 downregulation may play a signal-transduction role in this process."
612,"The Indolinone MAZ51 Induces Cell Rounding and G2/M Cell Cycle Arrest in Glioma Cells without the Inhibition of VEGFR-3 Phosphorylation: Involvement of the RhoA and Akt/GSK3beta Signaling Pathways."
613,"MAZ51 is an indolinone-based molecule originally synthesized as a selective inhibitor of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR)-3 tyrosine kinase. This study shows that exposure of two glioma cell lines, rat C6 and human U251MG, to MAZ51 caused dramatic shape changes, including the retraction of cellular protrusions and cell rounding. These changes were caused by the clustering and aggregation of actin filaments and microtubules. MAZ51 also induced G2/M phase cell cycle arrest. This led to an inhibition of cellular proliferation, without triggering significant cell death. These alterations induced by MAZ51 occurred with similar dose- and time-dependent patterns. Treatment of glioma cells with MAZ51 resulted in increased levels of phosphorylated GSK3beta through the activation of Akt, as well as increased levels of active RhoA. Interestingly, MAZ51 did not affect the morphology and cell cycle patterns of rat primary cortical astrocytes, suggesting it selectively targeted transformed cells. Immunoprecipitation-western blot analyses indicated that MAZ51 did not decrease, but rather increased, tyrosine phosphorylation of VEGFR-3. To confirm this unanticipated result, several additional experiments were conducted. Enhancing VEGFR-3 phosphorylation by treatment of glioma cells with VEGF-C affected neither cytoskeleton arrangements nor cell cycle patterns. In addition, the knockdown of VEGFR-3 in glioma cells did not cause morphological or cytoskeletal alterations. Furthermore, treatment of VEGFR-3-silenced cells with MAZ51 caused the same alterations of cell shape and cytoskeletal arrangements as that observed in control cells. These data indicate that MAZ51 causes cytoskeletal alterations and G2/M cell cycle arrest in glioma cells. These effects are mediated through phosphorylation of Akt/GSK3beta and activation of RhoA. The anti-proliferative activity of MAZ51 does not require the inhibition of VEGFR-3 phosphorylation, suggesting that it is a potential candidate for further clinical investigation for treatment of gliomas, although the precise mechanism(s) underlying its effects remain to be determined."
614,"Readmissions after Hospitalization for Heart Failure, Acute Myocardial Infarction, or Pneumonia among Young and Middle-Aged Adults: A Retrospective Observational Cohort Study."
615,"BACKGROUND: Patients aged >/=65 years are vulnerable to readmissions due to a transient period of generalized risk after hospitalization. However, whether young and middle-aged adults share a similar risk pattern is uncertain. We compared the rate, timing, and readmission diagnoses following hospitalization for heart failure (HF), acute myocardial infarction (AMI), and pneumonia among patients aged 18-64 years with patients aged >/=65 years. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We used an all-payer administrative dataset from California consisting of all hospitalizations for HF (n = 206,141), AMI (n = 107,256), and pneumonia (n = 199,620) from 2007-2009. The primary outcomes were unplanned 30-day readmission rate, timing of readmission, and readmission diagnoses. Our findings show that the readmission rate among patients aged 18-64 years exceeded the readmission rate in patients aged >/=65 years in the HF cohort (23.4% vs. 22.0%, p<0.001), but was lower in the AMI (11.2% vs. 17.5%, p<0.001) and pneumonia (14.4% vs. 17.3%, p<0.001) cohorts. When adjusted for sex, race, comorbidities, and payer status, the 30-day readmission risk in patients aged 18-64 years was similar to patients >/=65 years in the HF (HR 0.99; 95%CI 0.97-1.02) and pneumonia (HR 0.97; 95%CI 0.94-1.01) cohorts and was marginally lower in the AMI cohort (HR 0.92; 95%CI 0.87-0.96). For all cohorts, the timing of readmission was similar; readmission risks were highest between days 2 and 5 and declined thereafter across all age groups. Diagnoses other than the index admission diagnosis accounted for a substantial proportion of readmissions among age groups <65 years; a non-cardiac diagnosis represented 39-44% of readmissions in the HF cohort and 37-45% of readmissions in the AMI cohort, while a non-pulmonary diagnosis represented 61-64% of patients in the pneumonia cohort. CONCLUSION: When adjusted for differences in patient characteristics, young and middle-aged adults have 30-day readmission rates that are similar to elderly patients for HF, AMI, and pneumonia. A generalized risk after hospitalization is present regardless of age. Please see later in the article for the Editors' Summary."
616,"Development and Validation of a Harmonized TaqMan-Based Triplex Real-Time RT-PCR Protocol for the Quantitative Detection of Normalized Gene Expression Profiles of Seven Porcine Cytokines."
617,"Dysregulation of cytokine responses plays a major role in the pathogenesis of severe and life-threatening infectious diseases like septicemia or viral hemorrhagic fevers. In pigs, diseases like African and classical swine fever are known to show exaggerated cytokine releases. To study these responses and their impact on disease severity and outcome in detail, reliable, highly specific and sensitive methods are needed. For cytokine research on the molecular level, real-time RT-PCRs have been proven to be suitable. Yet, the currently available and most commonly used SYBR Green I assays or heterogeneous gel-based RT-PCRs for swine show a significant lack of specificity and sensitivity. The latter is however absolutely essential for an accurate quantification of rare cytokine transcripts as well as for detection of small changes in gene expressions. For this reason, a harmonized TaqMan-based triplex real-time RT-PCR protocol for the quantitative detection of normalized gene expression profiles of seven porcine cytokines was designed and validated within the presented study. Cytokines were chosen to represent different immunological pathways and targets known to be involved in the pathogenesis of the above mentioned porcine diseases, namely interleukin (IL)-1beta, IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-8, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha and interferon (IFN)-alpha. Beta-Actin and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) served as reference genes for normalization. For absolute quantification a synthetic standard plasmid was constructed comprising all target cytokines and reference genes within a single molecule allowing the generation of positive control RNA. The standard as well as positive RNAs from samples, and additionally more than 400 clinical samples, which were collected from animal trials, were included in the validation process to assess analytical sensitivity and applicability under routine conditions. The resulting assay allows the reliable assessment of gene expression profiles and provides a broad applicability to any kind of immunological research in swine."
618,"The individual N- and C-lobes of calmodulin tether to the Cav1.2 channel and rescue the channel activity from run-down in ventricular myocytes of guinea-pig heart."
619,"The present study examined the binding of the individual N- and C-lobes of calmodulin (CaM) to Cav1.2 at different Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]) from approximately free to 2 mM, and found that they may bind to Cav1.2 Ca2+-dependently. In particular, using the patch-clamp technique, we confirmed that the N- or C-lobes can rescue the basal activity of Cav1.2 from run-down, demonstrating the functional relevance of the individual lobes. The data imply that at resting [Ca2+], CaM may tether to the channel with its single lobe, leading to multiple CaM molecule binding to increase the grade of Ca2+-dependent regulation of Cav1.2."
620,"L Protease from Foot and Mouth Disease Virus Confers eIF2-Independent Translation for Mrnas Bearing Picornavirus Ires."
621,"The leader protease (Lpro) from foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) has the ability to cleave eIF4G, leading to a blockade of cellular protein synthesis. In contrast to previous reports, our present findings demonstrate that FMDV Lpro is able to increase translation driven by FMDV IRES. Additionally, inactivation of eIF2 subsequent to phosphorylation induced by arsenite or thapsigargin in BHK cells blocks protein synthesis directed by FMDV IRES, whereas in the presence of Lpro, significant translation is found under these conditions. This phenomenon was also observed in cell-free systems after induction of eIF2 phosphorylation by addition of poly(I:C)."
622,"Ambrisentan improves the outcome of rats with liver transplantation partially through reducing nephrotoxicity."
623,"OBJECTIVE: Tacrolimus is a potent immunosuppressive agent mainly used for allogeneic solid organ transplantation. Although usage of tacrolimus led to a significant increase in short-term allograft survival, the long-term morbidity remains high. Endothelin-1 (ET-1) is reported to be associated with increased vascular resistance, CNI-induced nephrotoxicity and chronic rejection. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In the present study, we first detected the serum and renal ET-1 level of rats treated by tacrolimus and found strong positive correlations were existed between the ET-1 level and the tacrolimus dosage and treated time. Furthermore, we studied the protective effect of ambrisentan in liver transplantation rats when co-administrated with tacrolimus. Healthy inbred male Wistar and Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were used in this study. The post-operative general condition, transplantation survival time, hepatic aminotransferase, serum IFN-gamma and level kidney injury biochemical index were recorded and compared to evaluate the immune response and outcomes in the recipient rats after liver transplantation. RESULTS: Our results indicate that ambrisentan prevents the changes of ET-1 content in rats of non-operative treatment group and reduced the nephrotoxicity in the rats with liver transplantation. Rats from ambrisentan co-administration group exhibited good postoperative condition and prolonged survival. CONCLUSIONS: Ambrisentan reverted some effects induced by tacrolimus in the kidney and indicated a positive potential for therapeutic benefit."
624,"Interventional treatment strategies of thoracic aortic pathologies."
625,"Chronic and acute diseases of the thoracic aorta, including aortic dissection and aortic aneurysm are attracting increasing attention both in the light of an ageing Western and Oriental population and with the proliferation of modern diagnostic imaging modalities. While classical surgical strategies still dominate the care for acute and chronic pathology of the ascending aorta and the proximal arch region, new endovascular concepts are emerging and are likely to evolve as primary treatment strategies for descending aortic pathology in suitable patients constituting the majority of cases. Additionally, aortic arch pathologies are becoming the target of hybrid approaches combining surgical head-vessel debranching and interventional stent-graft implantation in the attempt to improve outcome by avoiding the high risk of open arch repair or complete replacement. Nonetheless, due to the complexity of the underlying vascular disease, every patient should be discussed in a team consisting of cardiologists, cardiac surgeons, anaesthesiologists and radiologists and an individualized therapeutic strategy should be carried out in a center with experience in both endovascular and surgical procedures."
626,"Correlation between the embolism area and pulmonary arterial systolic pressure as an indicator of pulmonary arterial hypertension in patients with acute pulmonary thromboembolism."
627,"OBJECTIVE: We tested whether correlation between embolism area and pulmonary arterial pressure may serve as an indicator of pulmonary arterial hypertension in patients with acute pulmonary thromboembolism. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In total, 204 patients who underwent spiral computed tomography (CT) pulmonary angiography and ultrasonic cardiogram were enrolled. The patients were stratified according to their pulmonary arterial systolic pressure into those with normal values, or those with mild, moderate, or severe pulmonary arterial hypertension. The embolism area was quantified using Qanadli score. RESULTS: We found that embolism area correlated positively with pulmonary arterial systolic pressure (r = 0.514). Specifically, embolism areas of four study groups were, respectively, 17.72 +/- 13.61%, 18.25 +/- 13.78%, 33.39 +/- 10.99%, 40.46 +/- 15.75%, obviously increasing along with progression of the disease. Pulmonary arterial systolic pressure was above 41 mm Hg when the embolism area was >33%, and above 70 mm Hg with the embolism area of > 40%. CONCLUSIONS: Assessment of the embolism area is useful in the clinical evaluation of pulmonary arterial systolic pressure, but appears to be more applicable to moderate and severe pulmonary arterial hypertension."
628,"Usnic acid inhibits ER stress activation through AMPK signaling pathway in rat cardiomyocytes."
629,"OBJECTIVE: In the present study, we investigated the effects of usnic acid (UA) on the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress processes in rat cardiomyocytes. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Gene expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and activation of ER stress signaling were analyzed. Besides, levels of phosphorylated AMPK were measured to evaluate the mechanisms of UA. Finally, small interfering RNA (siRNA) oligos targeting AMPK subunits were used to determine the roles of AMPK in rat cardiomyocytes treated with UA. RESULTS: We found that UA treatment significantly reduced ER stress activation and expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, via an AMPK signaling-dependent manner. CONCLUSIONS: UA might be useful to reduce the occurrence of adverse cardiovascular events."
630,"Vacuum Assisted Closure (VAC) therapyTM as a swiss knife multi-tool for enteric fistula closure: tips and tricks: a pilot study."
631,"OBJECTIVE: Enterocutaneous fistulas (ECFs) are an uncommon surgical problem, but they are characterized by a difficult management. Vacuum-assisted closure (VAC) therapy is a method utilized for chronic and traumatic wound healing. At first, VAC therapy had been contraindicated in the treatment of intestinal fistulas, but as time went by, VAC therapy revealed itself to be a ""Swiss knife multi-tool"". This paper presents some clinical cases of enterocutaneous (ECF) and enteroatmospheric fistulas (EAF) treated with VAC therapy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The history of 8 patients treated for complex fistulas was revised. Four of them presented with enterocutaneous and four with enteroatmospheric fistulas. All were treated with VAC therapy with variations elaborated to help in accelerated closure of intestinal wall lesions. RESULTS: Four out of four ECFs closed spontaneously. In the EAF group, in three cases the fistula turned slowly into an entero-cutaneous fistula, and in one out of four it closed spontaneously. The mean length of VAC therapy was 35.5 days and that of spontaneous closure was 36.4 days. CONCLUSIONS: The results of our study encourage the use of VAC therapy for the treatment of enterocutaneous fistulas. VAC therapy use has a double therapeutic value: (1) it promotes the healing of the skin and allows also the management of EAFs; (2) in selected cases, those in which it is possible to create a deep fistula tract (""well"") it is possible to assist to a complete healing with closure of the ECFs."
632,"Qualitative motor assessment allows to predict the degree of motor disturbances."
633,"OBJECTIVE: Early diagnosis is necessary in order to determine neurological integrity and the potential risk of improper development, and also to undertake possible early intervention. The quantitative assessment consists of observation of motor development, and provides information about whether a child performs an activity (movement) expected at a given life period. The qualitative assessment of motor performance verifies whether a specific activity is performed properly. The papers aims to demonstrate the motor performance assessment sheet for infants at the age of 6 months and assessment of qualitative elements of 3rd month at the age of 6 months. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: 173 infants (76f/97m) were assessed by a neurologist and a physiotherapist at the age of 6 and 9 months. The neurologist set the final diagnosis at the age of 16 months. Additionally, the physiotherapist assessed qualitative elements typical of the 6th month and of the 3rd month. Risk factors possibly affecting motor performance were considered. RESULTS: The assessment performed by the neurologist and the physiotherapist demonstrated high conformity. Infants with varying degrees of developmental delay and with cerebral palsy at the age of 6 months have still not achieved all of the qualitative characteristics typical of the 3rd month of life, nor proper performance for the 6th month. The low Apgar score and the presence of intraventricular haemorrhage affected the motor development at the age of 6 months. CONCLUSIONS: The author's motor development assessment sheet applied at the age of 6 months proves to be a sensitive research tool and demonstrates good predictive value."
634,"Bickerstaff's brainstem encephalitis (BBE) in childhood: rapid resolution after intravenous immunoglobulins treatment."
635,"Three young patients with Bickerstaff's brainstem encephalitis (BBE) are reported. Some weeks following an upper tract infection, the children after a short period of recovery, showed acute onset of symmetric weakness of the lower limbs with difficulty in standing by and walking. The distal muscle weakness had a rapid progression with involvement of the cranial nerve, and then with severe impairment of the consciousness till to coma in one of the three children. BBE is a rare and often underdiagnosed affection in childhood. Common neuro-immune pathogenesis, overlap of clinical signs and strict correlation among BBE with Fisher syndrome and Guillain-Barre syndrome lead to think that these affections represent an unique spectrum with different central and peripheral involvement. In these children, treatment with intravenous immunoglobulins resulted in a progressive and rapid resolution of the clinical features."
636,"Effects of different antihypertensive drugs on blood pressure variability in patients with ischemic stroke."
637,"OBJECTIVE: Blood pressure variation is one of the factors that affects the risk of stroke recurrence and prognosis. This study investigates the effects of calcium channel blockers and beta-blockers on blood pressure variability in severe ischemic stroke patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The clinical data of 24 patients with ischemic stroke in our intensive care unit were analyzed, and received amlodipine or metoprolol for more than 14 days with 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring. All patients aged 61-90 years, with GCS score </= 8 or associated with other organ dysfunction. RESULTS: Among these 24 ischemic stroke patients, 12 received amlodipine and 12 received metoprolol. The observation period was divided into two phases: 1-6 days and 7-14 days. The decrease in blood pressure was faster in the metoprolol group than in the amlodipine group, while the average standard deviation was significantly greater and the smoothness index was less. CONCLUSIONS: Metoprolol has faster onset than amlodipine and less blood pressure variability than metoprolol."
638,"Prevalence of sleep disturbance in chronic pain."
639,"OBJECTIVE: Sleep is a vital function for human beings, which can be affected by several factors. Chronic pain is one of these factors where it is the most frequent cause for seeking medical care in combination with insomnia. The aim of this study is to examine the prevalence and relationship between sleep disturbance and chronic pain. PATIENTS AND METHODS: After approval, a total of 85 Family Medicine Units from over 170 in Tokat were randomly selected using a 50% sampling. A sample of 2635 subjects, over the age of 19 years, who were registered with the selected Family Medicine Units, were assessed due to gender, age group, and the urban/rural population size of Tokat using the stratified sampling method. The sample size distribution was calculated as 1515 urban subjects, 1120 rural subjects; 1345 female subjects, 1290 male subjects; 1123 subjects between 20-39 years of age, 1103 subjects between the ages of 40-64, and 409 subjects over 64 years of age. After sampling, subjects were invited to participate in the study via an invitation letter, and agreeing individuals were taken to the Family Medicine Unit for face-to-face meetings. Written, informed consent was obtained, along with demographic data. The presence of chronic pain was recorded. According to the presence of chronic pain, all subjects were separated into two groups as Group Chronic Pain and Group Non-Chronic Pain. The visual analog scale for pain intensity, and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index for sleep quality, were performed with all subjects. A multiple linear regression model was used to assess the predictors of sleep quality. Analyses were conducted using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences program (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA), version 20.0. The statistical significance for all analyses was set at p < 0.05. RESULTS: The mean global Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index score of Group Chronic Pain (5.30 +/- 4.29) was significantly higher than in Group Non-Chronic Pain (3.22 +/- 3.30; p < 0.01). The mean Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index scores of females (5.69 +/- 4.40) were significantly higher than males (4.54 +/- 3.96) in Group Chronic Pain (p = 0.000045). A total of 40.7% of patients in Group Chronic Pain, and 21.9% in Group Non-Chronic Pain demonstrated poorer sleep quality according to the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index scores, with a cut-off level > 5. A moderate positive correlation was found between the global Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index and Visual Analog Scale scores (r = 0.310, p < 0.01). A multiple linear regression analysis showed that age, gender, income, Visual Analog Scale, and presence of depression were the significant predictors for Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index score. CONCLUSIONS: The current study revealed that chronic pain and pain intensity are important predictors of sleep quality."
640,"Agents for refractory/relapsed acute lymphocytic leukemia in adults."
641,"Although treatment results for adult acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) have improved considerably in the past decades, treating adult patients with relapsed/refractory acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) is still difficult. Adults with refractory/relapsed acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) processed to death rapidly associated with chemotherapy resistance, high mortality by reinduction, etc. Only 20% to 30% of those patients acquired complete remission (CR). Those patients are always of short duration unless an allogeneic stem cell transplant is feasible. Median survival is only ranging from 2 to 12 months. Therapeutic strategy on relapsed/refractory acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) is always a major therapeutic challenge bothering hematological researchers. Novel agents and unique therapeutic strategies have been developed in recent years. This review focuses on major clinical advances in the agents for refractory/relapsed ALL."
642,"Efficacy of intratumoral chemotherapy using arsenic trioxide (As2O3) sustained release tablets for the treatment of neurogliocytoma in nude mice."
643,"OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate the inhibiting effect of arsenic trioxide (As2O3) on neurogliocytoma in nude mice and the mechanism responsible for this effect. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Neurogliocytoma implantation models were constructed in nude mice, which were assigned to three groups: the control group, the sustained release tablet-polylactic acid-glycolic acid polymer (50:50) group (PLGA group) and the As2O3-polylactic acid-glycolic acid polymer (50:50) (As2O3-PLGA group). One tablet of As2O3-PLGA was implanted in the tumor of the As2O3-PLGA group. Intratumoral implantation was also performed in the other groups using a different type of tablet. The sustained releasing As2O3 had an inhibiting effect on the tumors. The TUNEL assay was used to determine the apoptosis rates in the implanted tumors. Immunohistochemical staining and Western blotting was carried out to determine the expression levels of caspase-3 and Bcl-2. RESULTS: No inhibitory effect was observed on the tumor in the PLGA group, and there was no significant difference between this group and the control group. Subcutaneous tumor growth in nude mice was significantly inhibited in the As2O3-PLGA group relative to that in the control group, and the difference was statistically significant (p < 0.01). The tumor inhibition rate was 60.8%. The percentage of apoptotic tumor cells in the As2O3-PLGA group was 30.8%, which was significantly higher than that in the control group (3.92%) and that in the PLGA group (4.08%). The expression of Bcl-2 in the implanted tumor tissue was significantly reduced, but the expression of caspase-3 increased significantly. CONCLUSIONS: As2O3 has a potent inhibiting effect on the growth of neurogliocytoma in vivo and can induce the apoptosis of tumor cells. The molecular mechanism of this effect may be related to the downregulation of Bcl-2 expression and the upregulation of caspase-3 expression."
644,"Saikosaponin-d inhibits proliferation of human undifferentiated thyroid carcinoma cells through induction of apoptosis and cell cycle arrest."
645,"OBJECTIVE: Saikosaponin-d is a triterpene saponin derived from Bupleurum falcatum. L and has been reported to exhibit a variety of pharmacological activities such as anti-bacterial, anti-virus and anti-cancer. The aim of the present study was to explore the effect of saikosaponin-d on the proliferation and apoptosis of human undifferentiated thyroid carcinoma. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Three human anaplastic thyroid cancers cell lines were cultured in the presence of saikosaponin-d and their proliferation was measured by MTT assay. Cell apoptosis and cell cycle distribution were analyzed with flow cytometry. Western blot was performed to determine the proteins expression. The in vivo effect of saikosaponin-d was measured with an animal model. RESULTS: In vitro, MTT assay showed that saikosaponin-d treatment inhibited cell proliferation in three human anaplastic thyroid cancers cell lines ARO, 8305C and SW1736. In addition, saikosaponin-d promoted cell apoptosis and induced G1-phase cell cycle arrest as shown by flow cytometric analysis. On the molecular level, our results showed that saikosaponin-d treatment increased the expression of p53 and bax, and decreased the expression of Bcl-2. In addition, saikosaponin-d administration led to a significant up-regulation of p21 and down-regulation of CDK2 and cyclin D1. Xenografts tumorigenesis model demonstrated that saikosaponin-d markedly reduced the weight and volume of thyroid tumors in vivo. CONCLUSIONS: The present study suggested that saikosaponin-d might be a new potent chemopreventive drug candidate for human undifferentiated thyroid carcinoma through induction of apoptosis and cell cycle arrest."
646,"Wortmannin enhances cisplatin-induced apoptosis in human ovarian cancer cells in vitro."
647,"OBJECTIVE: The PI3K/Akt signaling pathway is constitutively activated in some ovarian cancers; when activated, it promotes invasion and inhibits chemotherapy-mediated apoptosis in cancer cells. The fungal metabolite wortmannin is the currently known inhibitors that show fairly high specificity for PI3K.We examined whether PI3K/Akt activity correlates with invasion and apoptotic resistance to chemotherapy in cultured human ovarian cancer cells, and whether inhibition of PI3K/Akt by wortmannin inhibits invasion and enhances cisplatin-induced apoptosis in cultured human ovarian cancer cells. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The cisplatin-sensitive A2780 ovarian adenocarcinoma cell line and its daughter line, A2780cis was evaluated for basal Akt activity. Chemotherapy-induced cell death was evaluated following down-regulation of Akt activity by wortmannin treatment or upregulation of Akt activity by myr-Akt treatment. Invasion and migration were assessed using Boyden chamber assays RESULTS: Inhibiting or activation of PI3K/Akt signaling pathway by wortmannin had little effect on the basal level of apoptosis in ovarian cancer cells, but increased the apoptotic effect of chemotherapy in A2780cis cells, decreased the apoptotic effect of chemotherapy in cisplatin-sensitive A2780 cells. Cisplatin resistant cells display increased potential for migration and invasion. CONCLUSIONS: The antiapoptotic effect of AKT activation in ovarian cancer cells confer invasive ability and resistance to apoptosis. Wortmannin is as adjuncts to conventional chemotherapy in the treatment of ovarian cancer."

650,"Autologous pericardium annuloplasty: a ""physiological"" mitral valve repair."
651,"AIM: Autologous pericardium annuloplasty (APA) is an alternative to prosthetic ring implantation for mitral valve (MV) repair, avoiding the use of foreign material and preserving the mitral annulus' physiological motion. However, data on durability are questionable. Therefore, we analyzed long-term outcomes of treating degenerative mitral regurgitation (MR) with APA. METHODS: Four hundred ninety patients (mean age, 54.3+/-11.3 years, [15-77 years]; N.=360 men [74.1%]) who had undergone APA and neochordae implantation between July 1988 and December 2006 were retrospectively studied. RESULTS: MR was purely degenerative in 434 (89.3%) patients; endocarditis was present in 44 (9.1%) patients; an anterior, posterior, or bileaflet prolapse was present in 32 (6.6%), 241 (49.6%), and 213 (43.8%) patients, respectively. Clinical follow-up was 100% complete at a median of 6.5 years (5th percentile, 0.9; 95th percentile, 14.9) with an echocardiographic study in 92% of patients. In-hospital mortality was 1% (5 deaths); overall and late cardiac mortality were 7.6% and 3.9% (37 and 19 deaths), respectively. Kaplan-Meier curves for overall survival, late cardiac survival, and freedom from reoperation at 15 years (20 cases) were 86% (95%CI 80-91), 93% (95%CI 88-96), and 93% (95%CI 88-96), respectively. At 15 years, freedom from recurrent MR (28 patients) and endocarditis (6 events) were 86% (95%CI 76-91) and 97% (95%CI 92-99). Dehiscence, significant calcification of APA, and hemolysis never occurred. At reoperations, annular pericardium appeared covered by a smooth layer of tissue. CONCLUSION: APA is feasible, safe, and cost-effective, providing long-term durability, high survival, and a low rate of valve-related complications."
652,"BRAF alterations in brain tumours: molecular pathology and therapeutic opportunities."
653,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To summarize the current knowledge on v-RAF murine sarcoma viral oncogene homologue B1 (BRAF) aberrations in tumours of the central nervous system. RECENT FINDINGS: BRAF alterations are found in variable frequencies across a wide spectrum of diverse central nervous system neoplasms. BRAF V600 point mutations (most commonly of the V600E type) are most common in pleomorphic xanthoastrocytoma (approximately 60% of cases), gangliogliomas (50%), dysembryoplastic neuroepithelial tumours (30%), Langerhans cell histiocytosis (50%), melanoma brain metastases (50%) and papillary craniopharyngiomas (96%) and are also detectable in a fraction of glioblastomas (overall mutation rate of 2-12%, with a higher rate of approximately 50% in epithelioid glioblastomas). BRAF fusions (most commonly KIAA1549: BRAF) are typical for pilocytic astrocytomas and are almost absent from other tumour types. Clinical trials have established tyrosine-kinase inhibitors of BRAF as feasible treatment option in selected patients with mutation-bearing brain metastases of melanoma. Preclinical studies, some case reports and small patient series have documented tumour responses of primary brain tumours with BRAF aberrations to BRAF inhibition. SUMMARY: Molecular testing for BRAF alterations in brain tumours may be of clinical relevance for differential diagnostic considerations in some situations or to guide selection of patients for targeted therapy with specific inhibitors. Prospective clinical trials evaluating the efficacy of BRAF inhibitors in central nervous system tumours are strongly supported by the available evidence."
654,"Prognostic Scoring Models for Patients Undergoing Sorafenib Treatment for Advanced Stage Hepatocellular Carcinoma in Real-Life Practice."
655,"BACKGROUND:: The purpose of this study was to build prognostic models capable of estimating the outcomes of individual sorafenib-treated advanced stage hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients based on specific patient and tumor factors. METHODS:: A parametric model for time-to-event data was used to construct scoring systems based on the intent-to-treat data set from 480 sorafenib-treated patients with advanced stage HCC: 356 for derivation and 124 for validation. Clinical parameters included in the models were based on importance variable scores generated by a random forest approach and bootstrap resampling. The model's accuracy was internally and externally assessed using the time-dependent C-index of discrimination and a Hosmer-Lemeshow type test for calibration. RESULTS:: The models generated for time-to-progression and overall survival based on Child-Pugh score, serum alpha-fetoprotein, tumor morphology, and vascular invasion and/or extrahepatic involvement had good calibration and discrimination abilities, with C-indexes of 0.669 (3 mo progression) and 0.809 (6 mo survival), respectively. External validation results also showed that these models performed well in terms of goodness-of-fit and discrimination (C-index: 0.746 for 3 mo progression and 0.875 for 6 mo survival). Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis in the validation patients indicated that these models have better predictive power than Child-Pugh scores (C-index: 0.686 for 3 mo progression and 0.777 for 6 mo survival). CONCLUSIONS:: The prognostic tools developed to quantify the potential outcomes for progression and survival expected from sorafenib treatment can serve as useful clinical aids in personalized decision making regarding treatment in advanced stage HCC patients."
656,"Hepatocellular Carcinoma Management in Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease Patients: Applicability of the BCLC Staging System."
657,"BACKGROUND/AIMS:: Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) has emerged as an important cause of chronic liver disease, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) system is the preferred staging system to evaluate patients with HCC and links prognosis assessment with treatment recommendation. The aim of this retrospective study was to evaluate whether the BCLC staging system and its treatment algorithm are suitable for patients with HCC arising from NAFLD. METHODS:: Forty-two patients with HCC related to either to NAFLD or cryptogenic cirrhosis were retrieved retrospectively from 2 centers in Brazil. Patients were classified according to BCLC staging system. If the proposed HCC therapy could not be applied, the case was considered to represent deviations from the recommended BCLC guideline. Causes of treatment deviations were investigated. RESULTS:: There were 4 patients without evidence of cirrhosis according to liver biopsy and/or clinical evaluation. One (2%), 21 (50%), 10 (24%), 5 (12%), and 5 patients (12%) were classified initially to the very early (0), early (A), intermediate (B), advanced (C), and terminal (D) BCLC stages, respectively. Thirty-five patients (83%) were treated according to BCLC recommendations. There were 3 cases (of 5) of protocol deviation in BCLC C patients. The 1- and 2-year overall survival rates were 81% and 66%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS:: The BCLC system is applied in most cases of NAFLD-related HCC cases. Deviation of BCLC is found more frequently in BCLC C stage patients.This is an open-access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivitives 3.0 License, where it is permissible to download and share the work provided it is properly cited.

658,"Late Toxicity and Outcomes in High-risk Prostate Cancer Patients Treated With Hypofractionated IMRT and Long-term Androgen Suppression Treatment."
659,"OBJECTIVE:: To assess late toxicity and outcomes in high-risk prostate cancer patients treated with hypofractionated radiation treatment with androgen suppression therapy. METHODS:: Sixty high-risk prostate cancer patients were enrolled. IMRT prescription was 68 Gy/25 fractions (2.7 Gy/fraction) to the prostate and proximal seminal vesicles (SV). The pelvic lymph nodes (PLN) and distal SV concurrently received 45 Gy/25 fractions (1.8 Gy/fraction). The patients were treated with helical TomoTherapy-based IMRT and underwent daily megavoltage CT image-guided verification before each treatment. RTOG Toxicity scores were recorded for a 5-year period. RESULTS:: Sixty patients completed RT with median follow-up of 63 months (range, 7 to 80 mo).At 5 years follow-up timepoint: Grade (G)2 and G3 late genitourinary toxicity was experienced in 7 (17.0%) and 1 (2.44%), respectively; gastrointestinal G2 as highest toxicity recorded in only 1 (2.44%) patient. There was no G3 gastrointestinal toxicity recorded at this timepoint.With 63-month median follow-up (mean of 65.41+/-1.72 mo), the 5-year overall survival was 86.67%; 5 years freedom from biochemical failure was 91.67% and freedom from clinical failure was 96.67%. CONCLUSIONS:: Dose escalation and hypofractionated radiation treatment with IMRT treating the prostate and proximal SV concurrently with the pelvic lymph nodes and distal SV and long-term androgen suppression therapy is well tolerated with respect to acute and late toxicity with 5-year actuarial overall survival 86.67%, freedom from biochemical failure 91.38%, and freedom from clinical failure 96.67%. Longer follow-up will provide more information on 10-year survival outcomes."
660,"Galangin suppresses HepG2 cell proliferation by activating the TGF-beta receptor/Smad pathway."
661,"Galangin can suppress hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cell proliferation. In this study, we demonstrated that galangin induced autophagy by activating the transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta receptor/Smad pathway and increased TGF-beta receptor I (RI), TGF-betaRII, Smad1, Smad2, Smad3 and Smad4 levels but decreased Smad6 and Smad7 levels. Autophagy induced by galangin appears to depend on the TGF-beta receptor/Smad signalling pathway because the down-regulation of Smad4 by siRNA or inhibition of TGF-beta receptor activation by LY2109761 blocked galangin-induced autophagy. The down-regulation of Beclin1, autophagy-related gene (ATG) 16L, ATG12 and ATG3 restored HepG2 cell proliferation and prevented galangin-induced apoptosis. Our findings indicate a novel mechanism for galangin-induced autophagy via activation of the TGF-beta receptor/Smad pathway. The induction of autophagy thus reflects the anti-proliferation effect of galangin on HCC cells."
662,"Comparison of Propofol, Etomidate, and Thiopental in Anesthesia for Electroconvulsive Therapy: A Randomized, Double-blind Clinical Trial."
663,"OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to compare the effects of propofol, thiopental, and etomidate, which are routinely used in anesthesia for electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), on the cardiovascular system, seizure variables, recovery, cognitive functions, and response to treatment. METHODS: Male patients hospitalized at the Seventh Psychiatry Clinics of the Bakirkoy Teaching Hospital for Psychiatry, Neurology, and Neurosurgery who were treated with ECT were investigated prospectively. The effects on cardiovascular system parameters (heart rate, blood pressure, and blood oxygenation), seizure variables (duration and intensity of seizure), and recovery variables were recorded at every session, on prespecified time points, and the findings of the first session were used in this evaluation. In addition, clinical responses to treatment were evaluated with tests of cognitive functions before and after a course of ECT. Adverse effects were recorded. RESULTS: The sociodemographic characteristics of the 3 treatment groups were similar. There were no significant differences among the groups in terms of effects on cardiovascular system variables, seizure variables, and cognitive functions. The clinical response to ECT was good in all groups, without any significant differences. CONCLUSIONS: Propofol, etomidate, and thiopental are associated with similar safety and efficacy profiles."
664,"Direct effects of recurrent hypoglycaemia on adrenal catecholamine release."
665,"In Type 1 and advanced Type 2 diabetes mellitus, elevation of plasma epinephrine plays a key role in normalizing plasma glucose during hypoglycaemia. However, recurrent hypoglycaemia blunts this elevation of plasma epinephrine. To determine whether recurrent hypoglycaemia affects peripheral components of the sympatho-adrenal system responsible for epinephrine release, male rats were administered subcutaneous insulin daily for 3 days. These recurrent hypoglycaemic animals showed a smaller elevation of plasma epinephrine than saline-injected controls when subjected to insulin-induced hypoglycaemia. Electrical stimulation of an adrenal branch of the splanchnic nerve in recurrent hypoglycaemic animals elicited less release of epinephrine and norepinephrine than in controls, without a change in adrenal catecholamine content. Responsiveness of isolated, perfused adrenal glands to acetylcholine and other acetylcholine receptor agonists was also unchanged. These results indicate that recurrent hypoglycaemia compromised the efficacy with which peripheral neuronal activity stimulates adrenal catecholamine release and demonstrate that peripheral components of the sympatho-adrenal system were directly affected by recurrent hypoglycaemia."
666,"Utility of galectin-3 as a prognostic biomarker in heart failure: where do we stand?"
667,"BACKGROUND: Heart failure (HF) continues to be an illness of daunting proportions with a four- year mortality touching 50%. Biomarkers for prognosticating patients with heart failure have generated immense interest. Several studies have been conducted on a novel biomarker, galectin-3 to assess its prognostic effect in heart failure populations. However, the studies have generated conflicting results. Hence a systematic review was done to assess the utility of galectin-3 as a prognostic biomarker in HF. DESIGN: This study was a systematic review. METHODS: A literature search was done using terms 'galectin-3 and heart' and 'galectin-3 and heart failure' in MEDLINE, Science Direct, Scopus, Springer Link, Cochrane Library and Google Scholar for original articles using a predefined inclusion/exclusion criteria. RESULTS: Altogether 27 original articles were selected for the systematic review. Multivariate analysis showed galectin-3 to be ineffective in predicting all-cause mortality and cardiovascular mortality especially under the influence of factors such as estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NTproBNP). Galectin-3 was not found to be superior to NTproBNP, sST2, GDF-15 or C-reactive protein (CRP) as a predictor of mortality. However the combination of natriuretic peptides and galectin-3 has been observed to be superior in predicting mortality compared to either of the biomarkers alone. The role of galectin-3 in remodelling has not been conclusively proven as seen in earlier pre-clinical studies. CONCLUSION: The current weight of evidence does not suggest galectin-3 to be a predictor of mortality. However, assessment of galectin-3 in a multi-biomarker panel may have a distinct advantage in prognosticating patients with heart failure."
668,"The Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale: A Reliability Generalization Meta-Analysis."
669,"The Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS) is the most frequently applied test to assess obsessive compulsive symptoms. We conducted a reliability generalization meta-analysis on the Y-BOCS to estimate the average reliability, examine the variability among the reliability estimates, search for moderators, and propose a predictive model that researchers and clinicians can use to estimate the expected reliability of the Y-BOCS. We included studies where the Y-BOCS was applied to a sample of adults and reliability estimate was reported. Out of the 11,490 references located, 144 studies met the selection criteria. For the total scale, the mean reliability was 0.866 for coefficients alpha, 0.848 for test-retest correlations, and 0.922 for intraclass correlations. The moderator analyses led to a predictive model where the standard deviation of the total test and the target population (clinical vs. nonclinical) explained 38.6% of the total variability among coefficients alpha. Finally, clinical implications of the results are discussed."
670,"The Effectiveness of the Personality Assessment Inventory With Feigned PTSD: An Initial Investigation of Resnick's Model of Malingering."
671,"Malingered posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) poses a formidable clinical challenge because of the apparent ease in feigning PTSD. As an additional confound, some patients with genuine PTSD produce elevated profiles on feigning indicators that are difficult to distinguish from feigned PTSD. The current study utilized 109 inpatients from a trauma unit to examine whether the Personality Assessment Inventory and the Detailed Assessment of Posttraumatic Stress can effectively differentiate between genuine and feigned PTSD. As a primary focus, Resnick's model of malingered PTSD was evaluated with its three subtypes: pure malingering, partial malingering, and false imputation. They were tested on their ability to (a) effectively simulate PTSD and (b) avoid being classified as feigning. The partial malingering group proved to be the best feigning group in achieving these two goals. Overall, the Personality Assessment Inventory Malingering Index and Negative Distortion Scale were the most effective at identifying feigning."
672,"Renal Sulfatides: Sphingoid Base-Dependent Localization and Region-Specific Compensation of CerS2-Dysfunction."
673,"Mammalian kidneys are rich in sulfatides. Especially papillary sulfatides contribute to renal adaptation to chronic metabolic acidosis. Due to differences in their ceramide anchors, the structural diversity of renal sulfatides is large. However, the underling biological function of this complexity is not understood. As a compound's function and its tissue location are intimately connected, we analyzed individual renal sulfatide distributions of control and ceramide synthase 2-deficient mice by imaging mass spectrometry and by LC-MS2, (in controls for cortex, medulla, and papillae separately). To explain locally different structures, we compared our lipid data with regional mRNA levels of corresponding anabolic enzymes. The combination of IMS and in source decay-LC-MS2 analyses revealed exclusive expression of C20-sphingosine-containing sulfatides within renal papillae, whereas conventional C18-sphingosine-containing compounds were predominant in medulla, and sulfatides with a C18-phytosphingosine were restricted to special cortical structures. Ceramide synthase 2 deletion resulted in bulk loss of sulfatides with C23/C24-acyl chains, but did not lead to decreased urinary pH as previously observed in sulfatide-depleted kidneys. Reasons may be the almost unchanged C22-sulfatid levels and constant total renal sulfatide levels due to compensation with C16- to C20-acyl chain-containing compounds. Intriguingly, CerS2-deficient kidneys were completely depleted of phytosphingosine-containing cortical sulfatides without any compensation."
674,"Phase II Study of Concurrent Chemoradiotherapy with S-1 in Patients with Stage II (T2N0M0) Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the Pharynx or Larynx."
675,"OBJECTIVE: The goals of treatment for head and neck cancer are cure and organ-function preservation. For organ preservation, primary treatment via radiotherapy alone is thought to be insufficient for Stage II squamous cell carcinoma of the larynx, oropharynx or hypopharynx. The objective of the present study was to investigate the efficacy and safety of concurrent chemoradiotherapy with S-1 for patients with Stage II squamous cell carcinoma of the pharynx or larynx for primary organ preservation. METHODS: Previously untreated patients with Stage II squamous cell carcinoma of the larynx, oropharynx or hypopharynx received three courses of S-1 (40 or 50 mg twice a day; 2 weeks of administration followed by 1 week of rest every 3 weeks) during conventional radiotherapy (a single daily fraction of 1.8 Gy) to a total dose of 70.2 Gy. The primary endpoint was the local control rate at 3 years. RESULTS: From August 2009 to October 2012, 37 patients were evaluated for the study. The overall response rate was 100%. The 3-year local control rate was 89.0% (95% confidence interval, 78.9-99.2%), and the 3-year overall survival rate was 97.2% (95% confidence interval, 91.8-100%). Mucositis and dermatitis in the radiation field were the most common acute adverse events observed. The rates of Grade 3 mucositis and dermatitis were 27 and 35%, respectively. No patients experienced Grade 4 acute adverse events. The treatment completion rate was 89.2%. CONCLUSION: Concurrent chemoradiotherapy with S-1 was safe and effective in improving local control for Stage II squamous cell carcinoma of the pharynx or larynx."
676,"Efficacy and safety of triple combination therapy with artesunate-amodiaquine-methylene blue for falciparum malaria in children: a randomised controlled trial in Burkina Faso."
677,"BACKGROUND: Methylene blue (MB) has been shown to be safe and effective against falciparum malaria in Africa and to have pronounced gametocytocidal properties. METHODS: Three days treatment with artesunate (AS)-amodiaquine (AQ)-MB was compared to AS-AQ in a randomised controlled phase IIb study in 221 children aged 6-59 months with uncomplicated falciparum malaria in Burkina Faso. The primary endpoint was gametocyte prevalence during follow-up determined by microscopy and by real-time quantitative nucleic acid sequence-based amplification (QT-NASBA). RESULTS: Gametocyte prevalence of P. falciparum at baseline was 3.6% (microscopy) and 97% (QT-NASBA). Gametocyte prevalence was significantly lower in the AS-AQ-MB compared to AS-AQ group on day 7 of follow-up (1.2% vs. 8.9% by microscopy, p<0.05; 36.7% vs. 63.3% by QT-NASBA, p<0.001). Haemoglobin values were significantly lower in the AS-AQ-MB group compared to AS-AQ at day 2 and 7 of follow-up. Vomiting of the study medication occurred significantly more frequently in children having been treated with AS-AQ-MB compared to AS-AQ. CONCLUSIONS: The combination of MB with an ACT has been confirmed to be effective against the gametocytes of P. falciparum. MB-based combinations need to be compared to primaquine-based combinations, preferably using MB in an improved pediatric formulation."
678,"Innate Inflammation Induced by the 8-Oxoguanine DNA Glycosylase-1-KRAS-NF-kappaB Pathway."
679,"8-Oxoguanine-DNA glycosylase-1 (OGG1) is the primary enzyme for repairing 7,8-dihydro-8-oxoguanine (8-oxoG) via the DNA base excision repair pathway (OGG1-BER). Accumulation of 8-oxoG in the genomic DNA leads to genetic instability and carcinogenesis and is thought to contribute to the worsening of various inflammatory and disease processes. However, the disease mechanism is unknown. In this study, we proposed that the mechanistic link between OGG1-BER and proinflammatory gene expression is OGG1's guanine nucleotide exchange factor activity, acquired after interaction with the 8-oxoG base and consequent activation of the small GTPase RAS. To test this hypothesis, we used BALB/c mice expressing or deficient in OGG1 in their airway epithelium and various molecular biological approaches, including active RAS pulldown, reporter and Comet assays, small interfering RNA-mediated depletion of gene expression, quantitative RT-PCR, and immunoblotting. We report that the OGG1-intiated repair of oxidatively damaged DNA is a prerequisite for GDP-->GTP exchange, KRAS-GTP-driven signaling via MAP kinases and PI3 kinases and mitogen-stress-related kinase-1 for NF-kappaB activation, proinflammatory chemokine/cytokine expression, and inflammatory cell recruitment to the airways. Mice deficient in OGG1-BER showed significantly decreased immune responses, whereas a lack of other Nei-like DNA glycosylases (i.e., NEIL1 and NEIL2) had no significant effect. These data unveil a previously unidentified role of OGG1-driven DNA BER in the generation of endogenous signals for inflammation in the innate signaling pathway."
680,"Mast Cells Control the Expansion and Differentiation of IL-10-Competent B Cells."
681,"The discovery of B cell subsets with regulatory properties, dependent on IL-10 production, has expanded our view on the mechanisms that control inflammation. Regulatory B cells acquire the ability to produce IL-10 in a stepwise process: first, they become IL-10 competent, a poised state in which B cells are sensitive to trigger signals but do not actually express the Il-10 gene; then, when exposed to appropriate stimuli, they start producing IL-10. Even if the existence of IL-10-competent B cells is now well established, it is not yet known how different immune cell types cross talk with B cells and affect IL-10-competent B cell differentiation and expansion. Mast cells (MCs) contribute to the differentiation and influence the effector functions of various immune cells, including B lymphocytes. In this study, we explored whether MCs could play a role in the expansion of IL-10-competent B cells and addressed the in vivo relevance of MC deficiency on the generation of these cells. We show that MCs can expand IL-10-competent B cells, but they do not directly induce IL-10 production; moreover, the absence of MCs negatively affects IL-10-competent B cell differentiation. Noteworthy, our findings reveal that the CD40L/CD40 axis plays a significant role in MC-driven expansion of IL-10-competent B cells in vitro and highlight the importance of MC CD40L signaling in the colon."
682,"Neutrophils Counteract Autophagy-Mediated Anti-Inflammatory Mechanisms in Alveolar Macrophage: Role in Posthemorrhagic Shock Acute Lung Inflammation."
683,"Acute lung injury (ALI) is a major component of multiple organ dysfunction syndrome after hemorrhagic shock (HS) resulting from major surgery and trauma. The increased susceptibility in HS patients to the development of ALI suggests not yet fully elucidated mechanisms that enhance proinflammatory responses and/or suppress anti-inflammatory responses in the lung. Alveolar macrophages (AMvarphi) are at the center of the pathogenesis of ALI after HS. We have previously reported that HS-activated polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs) interact with macrophages to influence inflammation progress. In this study, we explore a novel function of PMNs regulating AMvarphi anti-inflammatory mechanisms involving autophagy. Using a mouse ""two-hit"" model of HS/resuscitation followed by intratracheal injection of muramyl dipeptide, we demonstrate that HS initiates high mobility group box 1/TLR4 signaling, which upregulates NOD2 expression in AMvarphi and sensitizes them to subsequent NOD2 ligand muramyl dipeptide to augment lung inflammation. In addition, upregulated NOD2 signaling induces autophagy in AMvarphi, which negatively regulates lung inflammation through feedback suppression of NOD2-RIP2 signaling and inflammasome activation. Importantly, we further demonstrate that HS-activated PMNs that migrate in alveoli counteract the anti-inflammatory effect of autophagy in AMvarphi, possibly through NAD(P)H oxidase-mediated signaling to enhance I-kappaB kinase gamma phosphorylation, NF-kappaB activation, and nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain protein 3 inflammasome activation, and therefore augment post-HS lung inflammation. These findings explore a previously unidentified complexity in the mechanisms of ALI, which involves cell-cell interaction and receptor cross talk."
684,"Inflammasome Activation by Campylobacter jejuni."
685,"The Gram-negative pathogen Campylobacter jejuni is the most common cause of bacterial foodborne disease worldwide. The mechanisms that lead to bacterial invasion of eukaryotic cells and massive intestinal inflammation are still unknown. In this study, we report that C. jejuni infection of mouse macrophages induces upregulation of pro-IL-1beta transcript and secretion of IL-1beta without eliciting cell death. Immunoblotting indicated cleavage of caspase-1 and IL-1beta in infected cells. In bone marrow-derived macrophages from different knockout mice, IL-1beta secretion was found to require NLRP3, ASC, and caspase-1/11 but not NLRC4. In contrast to NLRP3 activation by ATP, C. jejuni activation did not require priming of these macrophages. C. jejuni also activated the NLRP3 inflammasome in human macrophages as indicated by the presence of ASC foci and caspase-1-positive cells. Analysis of a vast array of C. jejuni mutants with defects in capsule formation, LPS biosynthesis, chemotaxis, flagella synthesis and flagellin (-like) secretion, type 6 secretion system needle protein, or cytolethal distending toxin revealed a direct correlation between the number of intracellular bacteria and NLRP3 inflammasome activation. The C. jejuni invasion-related activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome without cytotoxicity and even in nonprimed cells extends the known repertoire of bacterial inflammasome activation and likely contributes to C. jejuni-induced intestinal inflammation."
686,"Variation and Genetic Control of Gene Expression in Primary Immunocytes across Inbred Mouse Strains."
687,"To determine the breadth and underpinning of changes in immunocyte gene expression due to genetic variation in mice, we performed, as part of the Immunological Genome Project, gene expression profiling for CD4+ T cells and neutrophils purified from 39 inbred strains of the Mouse Phenome Database. Considering both cell types, a large number of transcripts showed significant variation across the inbred strains, with 22% of the transcriptome varying by 2-fold or more. These included 119 loci with apparent complete loss of function, where the corresponding transcript was not expressed in some of the strains, representing a useful resource of ""natural knockouts."" We identified 1222 cis-expression quantitative trait loci (cis-eQTL) that control some of this variation. Most (60%) cis-eQTLs were shared between T cells and neutrophils, but a significant portion uniquely impacted one of the cell types, suggesting cell type-specific regulatory mechanisms. Using a conditional regression algorithm, we predicted regulatory interactions between transcription factors and potential targets, and we demonstrated that these predictions overlap with regulatory interactions inferred from transcriptional changes during immunocyte differentiation. Finally, comparison of these and parallel data from CD4+ T cells of healthy humans demonstrated intriguing similarities in variability of a gene's expression: the most variable genes tended to be the same in both species, and there was an overlap in genes subject to strong cis-acting genetic variants. We speculate that this ""conservation of variation"" reflects a differential constraint on intraspecies variation in expression levels of different genes, either through lower pressure for some genes, or by favoring variability for others."
688,"A Novel Method Using Blinatumomab for Efficient, Clinical-Grade Expansion of Polyclonal T Cells for Adoptive Immunotherapy."
689,"Current treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) patients often results in life-threatening immunosuppression. Furthermore, CLL is still an incurable disease due to the persistence of residual leukemic cells. These patients may therefore benefit from immunotherapy approaches aimed at immunoreconstitution and/or the elimination of residual disease following chemotherapy. For these purposes, we designed a simple GMP-compliant protocol for ex vivo expansion of normal T cells from CLL patients' peripheral blood for adoptive therapy, using bispecific Ab blinatumomab (CD3 x CD19), acting both as T cell stimulator and CLL depletion agent, and human rIL-2. Starting from only 10 ml CLL peripheral blood, a mean 515 x 106 CD3+ T cells were expanded in 3 wk. The resulting blinatumomab-expanded T cells (BET) were polyclonal CD4+ and CD8+ and mostly effector and central memory cells. The Th1 subset was slightly prevalent over Th2, whereas Th17 and T regulatory cells were <1%. CMV-specific clones were detected in equivalent proportion before and after expansion. Interestingly, BET cells had normalized expression of the synapse inhibitors CD272 and CD279 compared with starting T cells and were cytotoxic against CD19+ targets in presence of blinatumomab in vitro. In support of their functional capacity, we observed that BET, in combination with blinatumomab, had significant therapeutic activity in a systemic human diffuse large B lymphoma model in NOD-SCID mice. We propose BET as a therapeutic tool for immunoreconstitution of heavily immunosuppressed CLL patients and, in combination with bispecific Ab, as antitumor immunotherapy."
690,"Progression of Relapsing-Remitting Demyelinating Disease Does Not Require Increased TCR Affinity or Epitope Spread."
691,"In this study, we investigate the basis of T cell recognition of myelin that governs the progression from acute symptoms into disease remission, relapse, and chronic progression in a secondary progressive model of demyelinating disease. Until now, the frequency and affinity of myelin-reactive CD4 T cells that elicit relapsing-remitting disease have not been quantified. The micropipette adhesion frequency assay was used to obtain a sensitive and physiologically relevant two-dimensional measurement of frequency and TCR affinity for myelin, as the inherent low affinity does not allow the use of specific peptide:MHC-II tetramers for this purpose. We found the highest affinity and frequency of polyclonal myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein-reactive cells infiltrate the CNS during acute disease, whereas affinities during remission, relapse, and chronic disease are not significantly different from each other. Frequency analysis revealed that the vast majority of CNS-infiltrating CD4 T cells are myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein reactive at all time points, demonstrating epitope spread is not a predominant factor for disease progression. Furthermore, time points at which mice were symptomatic were characterized by an infiltration of Th17 cells in the CNS, whereas symptom remission showed an enrichment of cells producing IFN-gamma. Also, the ratio of regulatory T cells to Foxp3- CD4 T cells was significantly higher in the CNS at remission than during acute disease. The results of this study indicate that a high frequency of T cells specific for a single myelin Ag, rather than increased TCR affinity or epitope spread, governs the transition from acute symptoms through remission, relapse, and chronic disease states."
692,"Spontaneous clearance of hepatitis C virus in a patient co-infected with hepatitis C virus and human immunodeficiency virus: a case report."
693,"The effect of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) on hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection remains unclear. Spontaneous HCV clearance with initiation of HAART in non-cirrhotic HCV patients co-infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) has been reported. We describe an HIV/HCV patient with decompensated cirrhosis, who had spontaneous HCV clearance after an episode of elevated liver enzymes and a change in HAART regimen. His HCV RNA level remained undetectable for six months by quantitative and qualitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests. The disappearance of HCV RNA may be due to a combination of host immune recovery, genetic polymorphism and direct effect of HAART against HCV."
694,"A potential treatment of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease with SIRT1 activators."
695,"Sirtuins (SIRTs) are members of the silent information regulator-2 family and act as nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+)-dependent histone/protein deacetylases. The de-acetylation of proteins and histones results in an up- or down-regulation of gene transcription and protein function. In recent years, the regulatory action of the deacetylation activity of SIRT1 has been shown to have a positive impact on the pathophysiological mechanisms of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Among the effects of SIRT1 are: its healing activity on insulin sensitivity, thereby ameliorating glycemic regulation; its mimetic activity on calorie restriction; its antihyperlipidemic activity on lipid homeostasis via the liver, adipose tissues and skeletal muscles; its anti-inflammatory activities; its protective effects against cardiovascular events and endothelial dysfunction; its positive influence on autophagy, apoptosis and cancer; and finally, its anti-aging activity. The current approach for the treatment of NAFLD involves the treatment of etiological factors and recommendation of life-style changes including more physical activity and a low-calorie diet. However, there is no specific medical treatments for NAFLD. The therapeutic potential of SIRT1 activity in the treatment of NAFLD discovered in humans has been presented in this article. In this review, the potential effects of SIRT1 activation on NAFLD-related pathophysiological mechanisms and on the treatment of NAFLD are discussed."
696,"Pathophysiological and clinical approach to cirrhotic cardiomyopathy."
697,"Hyperdynamic circulation, systolic and diastolic left ventricular dysfunction and certain electrophysiological abnormalities have been associated with cirrhosis and known for a long time. These clinical features have been introduced as cirrhotic cardiomyopathy (CCM), which is characterized by blunted myocardial contractile responsiveness to physical, physiological and pharmacological stress. Importantly, cardiac dysfunction can be reversible and can improve due to effective medical treatment and also after liver transplantation. Echocardiography and electrocardiography are essential tools for recognizing the characteristic changes in the myocardial function and also the alterations in the electrophysiological properties of the heart. Laboratory markers are auxiliary modalities further aiding the establishment of the correct diagnosis. In this review, we aimed to collect the pathophysiological background and clinical characteristics of CCM with the intention of summarizing the current possibilities for the diagnosis establishment and treatment of this cardio-hepatic disorder."
698,"What non-alcoholic fatty liver disease has got to do with obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome and viceversa?"
699,"Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome (OSAS) are common conditions, frequently encountered in patients with obesity and/or metabolic syndrome. NAFLD and OSAS are complex diseases that involve an interaction of several intertwined factors. Several lines of evidence lend credence to an immune system derangement in these patients, i.e. the low grade chronic inflammation status, reckoned to be the most important factor in causing and maintaining these two illnesses. Furthermore, it is emphasized the main role of spleen involvement, as a novel mechanism. In this review the contribution of the visceral adiposity in both NAFLD and OSAS is stressed as well as the role of intermittent hypoxia. Finally, a post on the prevention of systemic inflammation is made."
700,"Standard versus limited colon resection for high risk T1 colon cancer. A matched case-control study."
701,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) recommends a colectomy in presence of high risk T1 colon polyps considering the risk of incomplete lymph node dissection or presence of residual disease. We evaluated the outcomes of segmental versus standard colon resection for high risk T1 colon cancers, in order to demonstrate if segmental colectomy (SegCR) allows same short-term and oncological results compared to standard radical colectomy (StaCR). METHODS. A matched case-control study on patients who had undergone segmental versus standard colon resection was performed. One-hundred and two patients with high risk T1 colon cancer after endoscopic polypectomy, divided in 2 homogeneous groups of 51 cases, were analyzed and intra-operative, post-operative and oncological data were compared. RESULTS. Segmental colectomy allowed less operative time and intra-operative blood loss compared to StaCR (p < 0.001). Hospital stay after SegCR was shorter compared to StaCR (p < 0.001). No differences were found in terms of overall morbidity and mortality rates. Five-year actuarial overall, disease-free and disease-specific survival after StaCR were similar to SegCR (87%, 96% and 95% vs. 88%, 97% and 94%, respectively, p = 0.51, p=0.33, p=0.78). CONCLUSIONS. According to our findings, SegCR can be a valid alternative to StaCR for high risk T1 colon polyps. Segmental colectomy allows better peri-operative outcomes compared to StaCR ensuring the same oncological long-term outcomes."
702,"Circulating tumor cells count predicts survival in colorectal cancer patients."
703,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Data on the potential of circulating tumor cells (CTC) count in predicting overall survival (OS) in patients with colorectal cancer are timely and worthy of interest. This study aimed to evaluate the prognostic role of CTC count in both localized and metastatic colorectal cancer patients. METHODS: Consecutive patients with histological diagnosis of colorectal cancer were enrolled. CTC count was performed, by using a quantitative immunofluorescence method, at baseline (T0) and 1 month following start of chemotherapy (T1). A CTC count <2 was considered negative, whilst a CTC level >/= 2 was positive. Overall survival was calculated accordingly. RESULTS: A total of 75 colorectal cancer patients were enrolled, including 54 stages I-III and 21 stage IV patients. Overall, 21 (28%) patients had a positive CTC count at baseline, and it was significantly associated with a worse prognosis as compared to a negative status (OS: 36.2 vs. 61.6 months; P = 0.002). CTC count remained positive after chemotherapy in 22.4% of the patients and it was an independent prognostic factor of OS (P = 0.03; Hazard Ratio: 3.55; 95% CI: 1.1-11.5). CONCLUSIONS: This study found that the presence of CTCs is associated with a reduced survival in colorectal cancer patients. Further studies aimed at testing such a predictive value in early stage colorectal cancer are awaited."
704,"Rapid fecal calprotectin level assessment and the SIBDQ score can accurately detect active mucosal inflammation in IBD patients in clinical remission: a prospective study."
705,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Mucosal healing is an important predictor of disease-related outcome in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients, including those in clinical remission. However, colonoscopy is an invasive procedure and many patients decline repeated endoscopic examinations. We aimed to assess whether noninvasive biomarkers could accurately detect endoscopic mucosal inflammatory activity in IBD patients in clinical remission. METHODS: We conducted a prospective observational cohort study on IBD patients in clinical remission at Colentina Hospital, Bucharest. Clinical activity was assessed using the Mayo score and Crohn's Disease Activity Index (CDAI), quality of life was assessed using the Short Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire (SIBDQ). Serum C-reactive protein (CRP) and fecal calprotectin (FC) levels were determined. All patients underwent ileo-colonoscopy to assess mucosal inflammatory activity. RESULTS: 48 patients were included in this study, with 67% showing endoscopic disease activity. SIBD questionnaire and FC performed well as noninvasive markers of intestinal inflammation (AUROC 0.78 and 0.77, respectively), while CRP could not accurately predict endoscopic disease activity. Fecal calprotectin levels > 30 microg/g showed a 93% sensitivity and a 50% specificity for detecting inflammatory changes of the mucosa while a combined test using FC > 30microg/g and a SIBDQ score < 6 achieved 81.2% sensitivity and 75% specificity, respectively, in detecting active endoscopic disease. CONCLUSION: Fecal calprotectin and SIBDQ have good diagnostic accuracy in detecting mucosal inflammatory changes in IBD patients in clinical remission. Combining simple, noninvasive tests such as the SIBDQ and FC levels appears to be a practical method for monitoring disease activity in these patients, possibly reducing the need for repeat endoscopic examinations."
706,"Mucosal expression of basic fibroblastic growth factor, syndecan 1 and tumour necrosis factor-alpha in Crohn's disease in deep remission under treatment with anti-TNFalpha antibodies."
707,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Both inflammation and fibrosis may be detected in Crohn's disease (CD). The molecular pattern of Basic Fibroblastic Growth Factor (bFGF) and Syndecan-1 (SD1) expression is altered in stenosing CD, but we do not know what the behaviour of this teamwork factor is in CD in deep remission under treatment with anti-TNFalpha antibodies. Our aim was to compare the expression of bFGF, SD1 and TNF-alpha in patients with CD in deep remission under treatment with Infliximab (IFX) or Adalimumab (ADA) and a control group of patients with active CD. METHODS: We assessed the expression of bFGF, SD1 and TNF-alpha in 10 patients with active CD and in 28 patients with CD in sustained deep remission for at least 6 months. All patients underwent surveillance colonoscopy with biopsies, while receiving maintenance therapy with IFX or ADA. Analysis was conducted by real-time reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) in biopsy samples. RESULTS: We found that bFGF, SD1 and TNF-alpha were significantly reduced under treatment with anti-TNFalpha versus controls (p=0.000). bFGF and SD1 expression were similar between IFX and ADA patients (p=0.335 and p=0.289, respectively), while TNF-alpha was significantly under-expressed in ADA patients (p=0.008). CONCLUSIONS: bFGF, SD1 and TNF-alpha are significantly reduced in CD patients in deep remission under treatment with anti-TNFalpha, likely as an expression of optimal control of inflammation. The significance of the TNF-alpha under-expression in patients under treatment with ADA with respect to those under treatment with IFX should be elucidated in further studies."

709,"BACKGROUND AND AIM: Cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated antigen-4 (CTLA4) is a crucial immune-checkpoint receptor regulating T-cell activation. The current study was carried out to evaluate the function of CTLA4 gene in patients with gastric cancer. METHODS: The methylation of CTLA4 gene promoter was evaluated by methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction (MSP) technique using 85 paraffin-embedded gastric cancer tissue samples and normal tissue on the tumor margins as control tissue samples. Expression analysis was performed on paraffin-embedded tissue samples (25 each of cancerous and normal tissues) using Real-time PCR. RESULTS: Statistically significant differences were observed between the tumor and margin-cell areas with respect to promoter methylation status (OR = 4.829, 95% CI: 2.46-9.48, p < 0.001) and CTLA4 expression profile (mean +/- SD = 7.56 +/- 17.35, p = 0.04). CONCLUSION: To the best of our knowledge, the current study is the first one highlighting the association between promoter hypermethylation of CTLA4 gene, decreased CTLA4 expression, and increased risk of gastric cancer."
710,"Use of Nonsteroidal Anti-inflammatory Drugs in Colorectal Surgery: Do the Risks Cast a Shadow on the Benefits?"
711,"Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) use is recognized as a key component of the Enhanced Recovery After Surgery protocols and is systematically recommended in colorectal surgery to optimize perioperative care. However, a red flag about this practice has been raised because clinical studies have recently pointed out an increased risk of anastomotic leak after colorectal surgery following NSAID administration. Therefore, we used the Bradford Hill criteria to examine this potential relationship and concluded that use of perioperative NSAIDs in colorectal surgery should be evaluated carefully and on an individual basis considering the potentially increased risk of anastomotic leak and its consequences."
712,"Disseminating hypnosis to health care settings: Applying the RE-AIM framework."
713,"Hypnosis is a brief intervention ready for wider dissemination in medical contexts. Overall, hypnosis remains underused despite evidence supporting its beneficial clinical impact. This review will evaluate the evidence supporting hypnosis for dissemination using guidelines formulated by Glasgow and colleagues (1999). Five dissemination dimensions will be considered: Reach, Efficacy, Adoption, Implementation, and Maintenance (RE-AIM). REACH: In medical settings, hypnosis is capable of helping a diverse range of individuals with a wide variety of problems. EFFICACY: There is evidence supporting the use of hypnosis for chronic pain, acute pain and emotional distress arising from medical procedures and conditions, cancer treatment-related side-effects and irritable bowel syndrome. ADOPTION: Although hypnosis is currently not a part of mainstream clinical practices, evidence suggests that patients and healthcare providers are open to trying hypnosis, and may become more so when educated about what hypnosis can do. IMPLEMENTATION: Hypnosis is a brief intervention capable of being administered effectively by healthcare providers. MAINTENANCE: Given the low resource needs of hypnosis, opportunities for reimbursement, and the ability of the intervention to potentially help medical settings reduce costs, the intervention has the qualities necessary to be integrated into routine care in a self-sustaining way in medical settings. In sum, hypnosis is a promising candidate for further dissemination."
714,"A Longitudinal Examination of the Moderating Effects of Symptoms on the Relationship between Functional Competence and Real World Functional Performance in Schizophrenia."
715,"BACKGROUND: Many individuals with schizophrenia experience remission of prominent positive symptoms but continue to experience impairments in real world functioning. Residual negative and depressive symptoms may have a direct impact on functioning and impair patients' ability to use the cognitive and functional skills that they possess (competence) in the real world (functional performance). METHODS: 136 individuals (100 men, 36 women) with schizophrenia were classified as having primarily positive symptoms, primarily negative symptoms, primarily depressive symptoms, or undifferentiated symptom profiles. Performance based measures of cognition and adaptive and interpersonal functional competence were used, along with ratings of real world behavior by high contact clinicians. Assessments were performed at baseline and at an 18-month follow-up. RESULTS: The relationships between neurocognition and capacity / performance were not moderated by symptom group ps > .091; neurocognition predicted capacity and performance for all groups ps < .001. The relationship between adaptive competence and adaptive performance was moderated by symptom group, ps < .01, such that baseline competence only predicted future performance ratings for participants with primarily positive or undifferentiated symptoms, and not for individuals with primarily negative or depressive symptoms. This same moderation effect was found on the relationship between interpersonal competence and interpersonal performance, ps < .002. CONCLUSIONS: Residual negative and depressive symptoms are distinct constructs that impede the use of functional skills in the real world. Depressive symptoms are often overlooked in schizophrenia but appear to be an important factor that limits the use of functional ability in real world environments."
716,"A novel, online social cognitive training program for young adults with schizophrenia: A pilot study."
717,"BACKGROUND: Pervasive social cognition deficits are evident early in the course of schizophrenia and are directly linked to functional outcome, making them an important target for intervention. Here, we tested the feasibility of use, and initiated the evaluation of efficacy, of a novel, neuroplasticity-based online training program (SocialVille) in young adults with schizophrenia. METHODS: Schizophrenia patients (n=17) completed 24 hours of online SocialVille game play either from home or at a clinic, over a 6-10 week period. We examined training feasibility, gains on the SocialVille exercises relative to matched healthy controls (n=17), and changes on measures of social cognition, social functioning, global functioning and motivation. RESULTS: Subjects adhered to training requirements, and rated SocialVille in the medium to high range in satisfaction, enjoyment, and ease of use. Subjects demonstrated significant, large improvements on the speeded SocialVille tasks, and small to moderate improvements on the working memory tasks. Post-training performance on the SocialVille tasks were similar to initial performance of the healthy controls. Subjects also showed improvements on standard measures of social cognition, social functioning, and motivation. No improvements were recorded for emotion recognition indices on the MSCEIT, or on quality of life scales. CONCLUSION: This study provides an initial proof of concept for online social cognition training in schizophrenia. This form of training demonstrated feasibility and resulted in within-subject gains in social functioning and motivation. This pilot study represents a first step towards validating this training approach; randomized controlled trials, now underway, are designed to confirm and extend these findings."
718,"ENDOTHELIN-1 SYTEM ACTIVITY IN ADULTS WITH BORDERLINE HIGH LDL-CHOLESTEROL."
719,"BACKGROUND: Modest elevations in plasma low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol have been shown to confer a significant increase in cardiovascular risk. Endothelin (ET)-1 is a vasoconstrictor peptide with proatherogenic properties. The experimental aim of this study was to determine whether ET-1 system activity is elevated in adults with borderline high LDL-cholesterol, independent of other cardiometabolic abnormalities. METHODS: Forearm blood flow (FBF; plethysmography) responses to intra-arterial infusion of ET-1, selective ETA receptor blockade (BQ-123), and non-selective ETA/B blockade (BQ-123 + BQ-788) were determined in 40 middle-aged and older adults (45-70 years): 20 with optimal/near optimal LDL-cholesterol (<3.4 mmol/L) and 20 with borderline-high LDL-cholesterol (3.4-4.1 mmol/L). RESULTS: Both groups demonstrated a similar, non-significant (~10%) reduction in FBF to ET-1. BQ-123 and BQ-123+788 elicited a modest, but significant, increase in FBF (~15-20%) in each group. However, there were no group differences in the FBF responses to either selective ETA or non-selective ETA/B receptor antagonism. CONCLUSION: Borderline-high LDL-C is not associated with increased ET-1 mediated vasoconstrictor tone. Disrupted ET-1 system activity may not contribute to the increased cardiovascular risk burden with borderline-high LDL-cholesterol."
720,"Burden Among Male Alzheimer's Caregivers: Effects of Distinct Coping Strategies."
721,"Focusing on the understudied, increasing population of male Alzheimer's disease (AD) caregivers, the purpose of this study was to identify their likelihood of utilizing 3 coping strategies (task focused, emotion focused, and avoidance focused) and to examine the effects of each coping strategy on caregiving burden. Data were collected from 138 male AD caregivers in southern United States, including geographically proportional representation of African Americans in the sample. Stepwise regression revealed effects of each coping strategy on caregiving burden, controlling for demographics. The sample reported high burden. Task focused was the highest reported coping strategy. Yet, regression models indicated no significant effect of task-focused coping on burden outcomes. Emotion-focused and avoidance-focused coping each showed significant proportional effects on burden. Implications suggest that emotion- and avoidance-focused coping among male AD caregivers may be maladaptive, that is, reinforcing burden. Male AD caregivers may benefit from more task-focused coping, such as planning and active problem solving."
722,"Personalizing Behavioral Interventions Through Single-Patient (N-of-1) Trials."
723,"Behavioral interventions are typically studied with the use of a conventional between-subject randomized controlled trial (RCT) design. In this design, the effect of an intervention on one group of patients is compared with the effect of a control condition on another group of patients, such that a between-subject change is tested. A between-subject design has an underlying assumption that there is a homogenous treatment effect for a behavioral intervention, drug or psychotherapy, and that the way the intervention operates in the study that will tend to operate in the same way in many other patients. We review some of the philosophical and practical problems with the use of this design when a clinician is attempting to decide on a course of behavioral treatment aimed at within-subject change in patients who are likely to have heterogeneous or unique responses to behavioral treatment. We also review the biases inherent in our current clinical practice model, which does not use any empirical data collection or design for testing if a treatment is useful, and also in the conventional between-subject personalized medicine RCT designs. We propose increased use of single-patient (also known as N-of-1) trials that employ within-subject designs, in cases where treatment response is heterogeneous-as is the case for most psychological and behavioral treatments. Limitations of such designs include that they can only be used when the treatment is potentially reversible, the patient can act as their own control, and the outcome can be measured repeatedly. Increased use of within-subject trials may address in many more instances the more clinically relevant question of how a specific patient will respond to a specific treatment, and could introduce a more harmonious scientific approach into the way we treat our patients. We have incorporated a case presentation that illustrates the complexities of applying evidence drawn from these different designs to selecting and evaluating treatments for the behavioral issues commonly faced by clinicians and patients."
724,"Nanomedicine in the Management of Microbial Infection - Overview and Perspectives."
725,"For more than 2 billion years, microbes have reigned on our planet, evolving or outlasting many obstacles they have encountered. In the 20th century, this trend took a dramatic turn with the introduction of antibiotics and vaccines. Nevertheless, since then, microbes have progressively eroded the effectiveness of previously successful antibiotics by developing resistance, and many infections have eluded conventional vaccine design approaches. Moreover, the emergence of resistant and more virulent strains of bacteria has outpaced the development of new antibiotics over the last few decades. These trends have had major economic and health impacts at all levels of the socioeconomic spectrum - we need breakthrough innovations that could effectively manage microbial infections and deliver solutions that stand the test of time. The application of nanotechnologies to medicine, or nanomedicine, which has already demonstrated its tremendous impact on the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries, is rapidly becoming a major driving force behind ongoing changes in the antimicrobial field. Here we provide an overview on the current progress of nanomedicine in the management of microbial infection, including diagnosis, antimicrobial therapy, drug delivery, medical devices, and vaccines, as well as perspectives on the opportunities and challenges in antimicrobial nanomedicine."
726,"Intratumoral pseudoaneurysms in hepatocellular carcinoma: do they occur de novo without any prior intervention? A tertiary care center experience of 6 years."
727,"BACKGROUND: Intratumoural pseudoaneurysms (ITPA) within hepatocellular carcinomas (HCC) usually arise as postprocedural complications of endovascular therapies or surgical procedures. Their de novo presence in HCC without any prior interventions has not been adequately described in medical literature. PURPOSE: To evaluate and quantify the presence of intratumoural pseudoaneurysms (ITPA) within hepatocellular carcinomas (HCC) prior to any intervention. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Retrospective cross-sectional review of 519 patients with HCC at a tertiary care university hospital with the purpose to evaluate and quantify the presence of ITPA present prior to any therapy. Patients' baseline data along with viral marker status, alpha fetoprotein (AFP) levels, imaging findings, and any prior treatment provided were recorded. Multi-detector computed tomography (MDCT) scans of selected patients were reviewed for presence of any ITPA and their incidence was calculated. RESULTS: ITPAs without any prior therapy were found in 5% (25/519) of patients with HCC. Seventeen of 25 (68%) patients had liver cirrhosis while eight of 25 (32%) patients were non-cirrhotic on imaging. Multiple ITPAs were seen in 44% (11/25) of patients. Eight percent (2/25) of patients had pseudoaneurysm-associated hemorrhage, 20% (5/25) had lung metastasis, 12% (3/25) had portal vein thrombosis, 8% (2/25) had hepatic vein thrombosis, and 16% (4/25) had peritumoral hematoma. The incidence of de novo ITPAs occurring in patients with HCC without any prior therapy or intervention was 0.24%. CONCLUSION: These cases provide a unique insight into an additional feature of HCC and usefulness of recognizing the ITPAs on imaging studies. Although de novo ITPAs in HCC are uncommon, occurring with an incidence rate of 0.24%, their presence in hypervascular hepatic lesion may point towards the diagnosis of HCC. Additionally, they should be accounted for in management planning as they can lead to complications of rupture and hemorrhage."
728,"Structure-activity analysis of a CFTR channel potentiator: Distinct molecular parts underlie dual gating effects."
729,"The cystic fibrosis (CF) transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) is a member of the ATP-binding cassette transporter superfamily that functions as an epithelial chloride channel. Gating of the CFTR ion conduction pore involves a conserved irreversible cyclic mechanism driven by ATP binding and hydrolysis at two cytosolic nucleotide-binding domains (NBDs): formation of an intramolecular NBD dimer that occludes two ATP molecules opens the pore, whereas dimer disruption after ATP hydrolysis closes it. CFTR dysfunction resulting from inherited mutations causes CF. The most common CF mutation, deletion of phenylalanine 508 (DeltaF508), impairs both protein folding and processing and channel gating. Development of DeltaF508 CFTR correctors (to increase cell surface expression) and potentiators (to enhance open probability, Po) is therefore a key focus of CF research. The practical utility of 5-nitro-2-(3-phenylpropylamino)benzoate (NPPB), one of the most efficacious potentiators of DeltaF508 CFTR identified to date, is limited by its pore-blocking side effect. NPPB-mediated stimulation of Po is unique in that it involves modulation of gating transition state stability. Although stabilization by NPPB of the transition state for pore opening enhances both the rate of channel opening and the very slow rate of nonhydrolytic closure, because of CFTR's cyclic gating mechanism, the net effect is Po stimulation. In addition, slowing of ATP hydrolysis by NPPB delays pore closure, further enhancing Po. Here we show that NPPB stimulates gating at a site outside the pore and that these individual actions of NPPB on CFTR are fully attributable to one or the other of its two complementary molecular parts, 3-nitrobenzoate (3NB) and 3-phenylpropylamine (3PP), both of which stimulate Po: the pore-blocking 3NB selectively stabilizes the transition state for opening, whereas the nonblocking 3PP selectively slows the ATP hydrolysis step. Understanding structure-activity relationships of NPPB might prove useful for designing potent, clinically relevant CFTR potentiators."
730,"Systematic review research on needle/syringe programs and opiate substitution programs in low- and middle-income countries."
731,"Persons who inject drugs (PWID) are at an elevated risk for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. In many high-income countries, needle and syringe exchange programs (NSPs) have been associated with reductions in blood-borne infections. However, we do not have a good understanding of the effectiveness of NSP in low/middle-income and transitional-economy countries. A systematic literature review based on PRISMA guidelines was utilized to collect primary study data on coverage of NSP programs and changes in HIV and HCV infection over time among PWID in low- and middle-income and transitional countries (LMICs). Included studies reported laboratory measures of either HIV or HCV and at least 50% coverage of the local injecting population (through direct use or through secondary exchange). We also included national reports on newly reported HIV cases for countries that had national level data for PWID in conjunction with NSP scale-up and implementation. Studies of 11 NSPs with high-coverage from Bangladesh, Brazil, China, Estonia, Iran, Lithuania, Taiwan, Thailand, and Vietnam were included in the review. In five studies, HIV prevalence decreased (range -3% to -15%) and in three studies HCV prevalence decreased (range -4.2% to -10.2%). In two studies, HIV prevalence increased (range +5.6% to +14.8%). HCV incidence remained stable in one study. Of the four national reports of newly reported HIV cases, three reported decreases during NSP expansion, ranging from -30% to -93.3%, whereas one national report documented an increase in cases (+37.6%). Estimated incidence among new injectors decreased in three studies, with reductions ranging from -11/100 person years at risk to -16/100 person years at risk. While not fully consistent, the data generally support the effectiveness of NSP in reducing HIV and HCV infection in low/middle-income and transitional-economy countries. If high coverage is achieved, NSP appear to be as effective in LMICs as in high-income countries. Additional monitoring and evaluation research is needed for NSPs where reductions in HIV/HCV infection among PWID are not occurring in order to identify and correct contributing problems."

734,"The Living Heart Project: A robust and integrative simulator for human heart function."
735,"The heart is not only our most vital, but also our most complex organ: Precisely controlled by the interplay of electrical and mechanical fields, it consists of four chambers and four valves, which act in concert to regulate its filling, ejection, and overall pump function. While numerous computational models exist to study either the electrical or the mechanical response of its individual chambers, the integrative electro-mechanical response of the whole heart remains poorly understood. Here we present a proof-of-concept simulator for a four-chamber human heart model created from computer topography and magnetic resonance images. We illustrate the governing equations of excitation-contraction coupling and discretize them using a single, unified finite element environment. To illustrate the basic features of our model, we visualize the electrical potential and the mechanical deformation across the human heart throughout its cardiac cycle. To compare our simulation against common metrics of cardiac function, we extract the pressure-volume relationship and show that it agrees well with clinical observations. Our prototype model allows us to explore and understand the key features, physics, and technologies to create an integrative, predictive model of the living human heart. Ultimately, our simulator will open opportunities to probe landscapes of clinical parameters, and guide device design and treatment planning in cardiac diseases such as stenosis, regurgitation, or prolapse of the aortic, pulmonary, tricuspid, or mitral valve."
736,"Dyspnoea management in acute coronary syndrome patients treated with ticagrelor."
737,"The occurrence of dyspnoea in acute coronary syndrome (ACS) patients has always been considered a challenging diagnostic and therapeutic clinical scenario. P2Y12 platelet receptor inhibitors (i.e., clopidogrel, prasugrel and ticagrelor) are currently the cornerstone of treatment of ACS patients. Thus, in the last few years, the potential association between ACS and dyspnoea has also become more challenging with the increasing use of ticagrelor in these patients due to its beneficial effects on ischaemic event prevention and mortality, since ticagrelor can induce dyspnoea as a side effect. The present article is intended to review the current literature regarding dyspnoea occurrence in ACS patients, especially those treated with ticagrelor, and to propose ticagrelor-associated dyspnoea management recommendations based on current knowledge."
738,"The correlation between the amplitude of Osborn wave and core body temperature."
739,"INTRODUCTION: Several reports illustrate an inverse correlation between the Osborn wave (J wave) amplitude and core body temperature. We attempted to study the strength of this correlation. METHODS: We reviewed all articles reporting hypothermic J waves from 1950-2014 for patient demographics, core body temperature in Celsius ( degrees C), amplitude of the J wave in millimeters (mm), lead with the highest amplitude of J wave, presence of acidosis, PO2, electrolytes and outcome. In cases with more than one electrocardiogram (ECG), the respective core body temperature and J wave amplitude of each ECG were recorded. The main study outcome is to evaluate the correlation between the J wave amplitude and core body temperature in the admission ECG. We have also examined the strength of this relationship in cases with more than one ECG. We attempted to find the most frequent lead that recorded the highest amplitude of the J wave in addition to the correlation between the amplitude of J wave and pH. RESULTS: We found 64 articles comprising a total of 68 cases. When analyzing only cases with more than one reported ECG, there was a strong inverse correlation (r= - 0.682, p<0.001) between J wave amplitude and body temperature: however, when analyzing admission ECG of all cases, the correlation was only moderate (r= - 0.410, p<0.001). The lead with the highest amplitude of the J wave was V4 (44% of the cases, p<0.001) followed by V3 (23.7% of the cases, p<0.001). CONCLUSION: The amplitude of the J wave in the admission ECG of hypothermic patients may not accurately predict the core body temperature."
740,"How to use: nutritional assessment in neonates."
741,"Adequate nutrition and growth during the neonatal period are important, especially for preterm infants, for whom there is evidence of poor nutrient intakes and growth, and this has important implications for their health in later life. Increased nutritional support while on the neonatal intensive care unit has been shown to improve growth, but such support is not universally available. Being able to carry out and interpret a nutritional assessment is therefore an important skill for paediatricians caring for neonates. This article aims to explain how to use nutritional assessment in neonates and provides some tools to make this process as straightforward as possible."
742,"Temporal changes in land cover types and the incidence of malaria in Mangalore, India."
743,"BACKGROUND: Malaria contributes to 881000 deaths worldwide annually and India is a major contributor in the region. This study aimed at detecting land cover changes and assesses their relationship with the burden of malaria in Mangalore taluk of southern India. METHODOLOGY: Landsat TM images were obtained from the U.S. Geological Survey data repository. The statistics for the malaria incidences in the region were obtained from the National Vector Borne Diseases Control Program division of the State of Karnataka. The images were preprocessed, classified and change detection statistics were employed for major land cover types. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: An increase in the urban land cover by 20% with a reduction in the mountainous terrain by 34.7% and vegetation by 38.7% was noted between the years 2003 and 2005. The annual incidence of malaria increased five-fold from 203 to 1035/100000 population during the period. This study demonstrates the application of publicly available remote sensed data as a cost effective approach to study the agent, host and environment relationships in resource scarce settings which would provide valuable information planning and policy making at regional levels."
744,"Nonlinear and Stochastic Dynamics in the Heart."
745,"In a normal human life span, the heart beats about 2 to 3 billion times. Under diseased conditions, a heart may lose its normal rhythm and degenerate suddenly into much faster and irregular rhythms, called arrhythmias, which may lead to sudden death. The transition from a normal rhythm to an arrhythmia is a transition from regular electrical wave conduction to irregular or turbulent wave conduction in the heart, and thus this medical problem is also a problem of physics and mathematics. In the last century, clinical, experimental, and theoretical studies have shown that dynamical theories play fundamental roles in understanding the mechanisms of the genesis of the normal heart rhythm as well as lethal arrhythmias. In this article, we summarize in detail the nonlinear and stochastic dynamics occurring in the heart and their links to normal cardiac functions and arrhythmias, providing a holistic view through integrating dynamics from the molecular (microscopic) scale, to the organelle (mesoscopic) scale, to the cellular, tissue, and organ (macroscopic) scales. We discuss what existing problems and challenges are waiting to be solved and how multi-scale mathematical modeling and nonlinear dynamics may be helpful for solving these problems."
746,"Interpersonal Emotion Regulation Model of Mood and Anxiety Disorders."
747,"Although social factors are of critical importance in the development and maintenance of emotional disorders, the contemporary view of emotion regulation has been primarily limited to intrapersonal processes. Based on diverse perspectives pointing to the communicative function of emotions, the social processes in self-regulation, and the role of social support, this article presents an interpersonal model of emotion regulation of mood and anxiety disorders. This model provides a theoretical framework to understand and explain how mood and anxiety disorders are regulated and maintained through others. The literature, which provides support for the model, is reviewed and the clinical implications are discussed."

750,"RADIATION SAFETY CONSIDERATION DURING INTRAOPERATIVE RADIATION THERAPY."
751,"Using in-house-designed phantoms, the authors evaluated radiation exposure rates in the vicinity of a newly acquired intraoperative radiation therapy (IORT) system: Axxent Electronic Brachytherapy System. The authors also investigated the perimeter radiation levels during three different clinical intraoperative treatments (breast, floor of the mouth and bilateral neck cancer patients). Radiation surveys during treatment delivery indicated that IORT using the surface applicator and IORT using balloons inserted into patient body give rise to exposure rates of 200 mR h-1, 30 cm from a treated area. To reduce the exposure levels, movable lead shields should be used as they reduce the exposure rates by >95 %. The authors' measurements suggest that intraoperative treatment using the 50-kVp X-ray source can be administered in any regular operating room without the need for radiation shielding modification as long as the operators utilise lead aprons and/or stand behind lead shields."
752,"Chevron formation of the zebrafish muscle segments."
753,"The muscle segments of fish have a folded shape, termed a chevron, which is thought to be optimal for the undulating body movements of swimming. However, the mechanism shaping the chevron during embryogenesis is not understood. Here, we use time-lapse microscopy of developing zebrafish embryos spanning the entire somitogenesis period to quantitate the dynamics of chevron shape development. Comparing such time courses with the start of movements in wildtype zebrafish and analyzing immobile mutants, we show that the previously implicated body movements do not play a role in chevron formation. Further, the monotonic increase of chevron angle along the anteroposterior axis revealed by our data constrains or rules out possible contributions by previously proposed mechanisms. In particular, we find that muscle pioneers are not required for chevron formation. We put forward a tension-and-resistance mechanism involving interactions between intra-segmental tension and segment boundaries. To evaluate this mechanism, we derive and analyze a mechanical model of a chain of contractile and resisting elements. The predictions of this model are verified by comparison to experimental data. Altogether, our results support the notion that a simple physical mechanism suffices to self-organize the observed spatiotemporal pattern in chevron formation."
754,"Immunization of mice with live-attenuated late liver stage-arresting P. yoelii parasites generates protective antibody responses to pre-erythrocytic stages of malaria."
755,"Understanding protective immunity against malaria is essential for the design of an effective vaccine to prevent the large number of infections and deaths caused by this parasitic disease. To date, whole parasite immunization with attenuated parasites is the most effective method to confer sterile protection against malaria infection in clinical trials. Mouse model studies have highlighted the essential role that CD8+ T cells play in protection against pre-erythrocytic stages of malaria; however there is mounting evidence that antibodies are also important in this stage. Herein, we show that experimental immunization of mice with Pyfabb/f-, a genetically attenuated rodent malaria parasite that arrests late in the liver stage, induced functional antibodies that inhibited hepatocyte invasion in vitro and reduced liver stage burden in vivo. These antibodies were sufficient to induce sterile protection from challenge by P. yoelii sporozoites in the absence of T cells in 50% of mice when sporozoites were administered by mosquito bite, but not by intravenous injection. Moreover, among mice challenged by mosquito bite, a higher proportion of BALB/c mice than C57BL/6 mice developed sterile protection (62.5% and 37.5%, respectively). Analysis of the antibody isotypes induced by immunization with Pyfabb/f- showed that overall, BALB/c mice developed an IgG1 biased response, whereas C57BL/6 mice developed an IgG2b/c biased response. Our data demonstrate for the first time that antibodies induced by experimental immunization of mice with a genetically attenuated rodent parasite play a protective role during the pre-erythrocytic stages of malaria. Furthermore, they highlight the importance of considering both the route of challenge and the genetic background of the mouse strains used when interpreting vaccine efficacy studies in animal models of malaria infection."
756,"Goal-directed learning and obsessive-compulsive disorder."
757,"Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) has become a paradigmatic case of goal-directed dysfunction in psychiatry. In this article, we review the neurobiological evidence, historical and recent, that originally led to this supposition and continues to support a habit hypothesis of OCD. We will then discuss a number of recent studies that have directly tested this hypothesis, using behavioural experiments in patient populations. Based on this research evidence, which suggests that rather than goal-directed avoidance behaviours, compulsions in OCD may derive from manifestations of excessive habit formation, we present the details of a novel account of the functional relationship between these habits and the full symptom profile of the disorder. Borrowing from a cognitive dissonance framework, we propose that the irrational threat beliefs (obsessions) characteristic of OCD may be a consequence, rather than an instigator, of compulsive behaviour in these patients. This lays the foundation for a potential shift in both clinical and neuropsychological conceptualization of OCD and related disorders. This model may also prove relevant to other putative disorders of compulsivity, such as substance dependence, where the experience of 'wanting' drugs may be better understood as post hoc rationalizations of otherwise goal-insensitive, stimulus-driven behaviour."
758,"The 30-year wait for treatment of an acutely painful knee."
759,"A 63-year-old retired man presented to our clinic reporting a severely painful, localised knee pain present for around 30 years and associated with a spontaneous palpable lump. He was prompted to seek medical advice at this point because his symptoms were exacerbated when his young grandchildren bumped into the knee. While radiographs were unhelpful, ultrasonography revealed a well-defined, subcutaneous soft tissue mass at the anterior aspect of the knee. Surgical excision was performed as a day case. Histological examination of the mass showed a glomus tumour. This patient had suffered for many years as a result of this painful mass but full resolution of his pain occurred immediately after excision."

761,"Waterhouse-Friderichsen syndrome (fulminant meningococcaemia) is a fulminating infection, often leading to mortality in a matter of hours. In the past 3 years there has been a rise in cases of Neisseria meningitis in the men who have sex with men (MSM) population in the USA and sporadic cases over the world especially in those who are HIV positive. We describe a case of a 34-year-old Caucasian man who presented with acute fulminant meningococcaemia, which proved fatal over a period of hours. This case report emphasises the need for further vigilance, prompt diagnosis and treatment of fulminant meningococcaemia without signs of meningitis especially in the MSM population and the need to expand vaccination recommendations of Meningococcaemia in the MSM population across the USA in both HIV positive and negative males."

763,"A 61-year-old woman being treated with methotrexate (MTX) 8-10 mg/week and prednisolone 2.5 mg/day for rheumatoid arthritis presented with a 1-week history of increasing fever and dry cough. The patient deteriorated with administration of antibiotics. Chest CT scan showed bilateral diffuse ground-glass opacities. Analysis of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) revealed marked neutrophilia (65.2% of total cells). The specimen from transbronchial lung biopsy showed a non-specific interstitial pneumonia pattern. Following withdrawal of the MTX, her pulmonary infiltration, clinical symptoms and laboratory findings gradually improved. Therefore, she was diagnosed as having MTX-induced pneumonitis. Lymphocytosis in BALF has been identified as a characteristic of MTX-induced pneumonitis, particularly in late onset of this disease. However, the BALF in our patient was neutrophilic. Although neutrophilia in BALF of patients with drug-induced pneumonitis is usually associated with poor outcome, rare cases of good outcome do exist."
764,"AS, DISH or something else?"
765,"A 68-year-old farmer presented with progressively worsening pain in multiple joints associated with stiffening for 9 months. Locomotor examination revealed grossly restricted movement of the axial skeleton. There were no neurological deficits. Radiological evaluation demonstrated diffuse bone densification and extraspinal calcification with bony ankylosis reminiscent of ankylosing spondylitis. Laboratory tests subsequently yielded the true diagnosis. The patient was counselled accordingly and started on appropriate therapy."
766,"CT diagnosis of an iatrogenic bile duct injury."
767,"Bile duct injuries are a recognised complication of cholecystectomy and a number of options exist for their evaluation. A 44-year-old woman presented with a suspected biliary leak 11 days following an open cholecystectomy. Her medical history was significant for biliopancreatic diversion 2 years previously. An ultrasound scan demonstrated a perihepatic collection but no dilation of the biliary tree was observed. The patient's surgical history and the lack of biliary dilation precluded an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography or percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography, and she could not undergo an MR cholangiopancreatography due to claustrophobia. A CT cholangiogram was performed and clarified the location of the injury, facilitating operative identification and repair of the bile duct. CT cholangiography performed as a dynamic procedure is useful as a means of identifying bile duct injuries."
768,"The biology of radiosurgery and its clinical applications for brain tumors."
769,"Stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) was developed decades ago but only began to impact brain tumor care when it was coupled with high-resolution brain imaging techniques such as computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging. The technique has played a key role in the management of virtually all forms of brain tumor. We reviewed the radiobiological principles of SRS on tissue and how they pertain to different brain tumor disorders. We reviewed the clinical outcomes on the most common indications. This review found that outcomes are well documented for safety and efficacy and show increasing long-term outcomes for benign tumors. Brain metastases SRS is common, and its clinical utility remains in evolution. The role of SRS in brain tumor care is established. Together with surgical resection, conventional radiotherapy, and medical therapies, patients have an expanding list of options for their care. Clinicians should be familiar with radiosurgical principles and expected outcomes that may pertain to different brain tumor scenarios."
770,"Nebivolol, But Not Metoprolol, Lowers Blood Pressure in Nitric Oxide-Sensitive Human Hypertension."
771,"Nebivolol, unlike other selective beta1-receptor blockers, induces vasodilation attributable to increased NO bioavailability. The relative contribution of this mechanism to the blood pressure (BP)-lowering effects of nebivolol is unclear because it is normally masked by baroreflex buffering. Autonomic failure provides a unique model of hypertension devoid of autonomic modulation but sensitive to the hypotensive effects of NO potentiation. We tested the hypothesis that nebivolol would decrease BP in these patients through a mechanism independent of beta-blockade. We randomized 20 autonomic failure patients with supine hypertension (14 men; 69+/-2 years) to receive a single oral dose of placebo, nebivolol 5 mg, metoprolol 50 mg (negative control), and sildenafil 25 mg (positive control) on separate nights in a double-blind, crossover study. Supine BP was monitored every 2 hours from 8:00 pm to 8:00 am. Compared with placebo, sildenafil and nebivolol decreased systolic BP during the night (P<0.001 and P=0.036, by mixed-effects model, maximal systolic BP reduction 8-hour postdrug of -20+/-6 and -24+/-9 mm Hg, respectively), whereas metoprolol had no effect. In a subanalysis, we divided patients into sildenafil responders (BP fall >20 mm Hg at 4:00 am) and nonresponders. Nebivolol significantly lowered systolic BP in sildenafil responders (-44+/-13 mm Hg) but not in nonresponders (1+/-11 mm Hg). Despite lowering nighttime BP, nebivolol did not worsen morning orthostatic tolerance compared with placebo. In conclusion, nebivolol effectively lowered supine hypertension in autonomic failure, independent of beta1-blockade. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that NO potentiation contributes significantly to the antihypertensive effect of nebivolol."
772,"Prenatal Hypoxia Leads to Increased Muscle Sympathetic Nerve Activity, Sympathetic Hyperinnervation, Premature Blunting of Neuropeptide Y Signaling, and Hypertension in Adult Life."
773,"Adverse conditions prenatally increase the risk of cardiovascular disease, including hypertension. Chronic hypoxia in utero (CHU) causes endothelial dysfunction, but whether sympathetic vasoconstrictor nerve functioning is altered is unknown. We, therefore, compared in male CHU and control (N) rats muscle sympathetic nerve activity, vascular sympathetic innervation density, and mechanisms of sympathetic vasoconstriction. In young (Y)-CHU and Y-N rats ( approximately 3 months), baseline arterial blood pressure was similar. However, tonic muscle sympathetic nerve activity recorded focally from arterial vessels of spinotrapezius muscle had higher mean frequency in Y-CHU than in Y-N rats (0.56+/-0.075 versus 0.33+/-0.036 Hz), and the proportions of single units with high instantaneous frequencies (1-5 and 6-10 Hz) being greater in Y-CHU rats. Sympathetic innervation density of tibial arteries was approximately 50% greater in Y-CHU than in Y-N rats. Increases in femoral vascular resistance evoked by sympathetic stimulation at low frequency (2 Hz for 2 minutes) and bursts at 20 Hz were substantially smaller in Y-CHU than in Y-N rats. In Y-N only, the neuropeptide Y Y1-receptor antagonist BIBP3226 attenuated these responses. By contrast, baseline arterial blood pressure was higher in middle-aged (M)-CHU than in M-N rats ( approximately 9 months; 139+/-3 versus 126+/-3 mm Hg, respectively). BIBP3226 had no effect on femoral vascular resistance increases evoked by 2 Hz or 20 Hz bursts in M-N or M-CHU rats. These results indicate that fetal programming induced by prenatal hypoxia causes an increase in centrally generated muscle sympathetic nerve activity in youth and hypertension by middle age. This is associated with blunting of sympathetically evoked vasoconstriction and its neuropeptide Y component that may reflect premature vascular aging and contribute to increased risk of cardiovascular disease."
774,"Effect of Hypoglycemia on Brain Structure in People With Type 2 Diabetes: Epidemiological Analysis of the ACCORD-MIND MRI Trial."
775,"OBJECTIVE: The effect of hypoglycemia related to treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) on brain structure remains unclear. We aimed to assess whether symptomatic severe hypoglycemia is associated with brain atrophy and/or white matter abnormalities. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We included T2DM participants with brain MRI from the Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes-Memory in Diabetes (ACCORD-MIND) trial. Symptomatic severe hypoglycemia was defined as blood glucose <2.8 mmol/L or symptoms resolved with treatments that required the assistance of another person or medical assistance (hypoglycemia requiring assistance [HA]). Standardized brain MRI was performed at baseline and at 40 months. Total brain volume (TBV) and abnormal white matter (AWM) volume were calculated using an automated computer algorithm. Brain MRI scans of hypoglycemic participants were also reviewed for local disease. RESULTS: Of the 503 T2DM participants (mean age, 62 years) with successful baseline and 40-month brain MRI, 28 had at least one HA episode during the 40-month follow-up. Compared with participants without HA, those with HA had marginally significant less atrophy (less decrease in TBV) from baseline to 40 months (-9.55 [95% CI -15.21, -3.90] vs. -15.38 [95% CI -16.64, -14.12], P = 0.051), and no significant increase of AWM volume (2.06 [95% CI 1.71, 2.49] vs. 1.84 [95% CI 1.76, 1.91], P = 0.247). In addition, no unexpected local signal changes or volume loss were seen on hypoglycemic participants' brain MRI scans. CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that hypoglycemia related to T2DM treatment may not accentuate brain pathology, specifically brain atrophy or white matter abnormalities."
776,"Immunoglobulin E plays an immunoregulatory role in lupus."
777,"The (patho)physiological role of IgE in nonallergic inflammatory diseases is not well understood. Here, we explored the effect of IgE deficiency on the inflammatory response in FcgammaRIIB-deficient mice as well as in mice carrying both a deletion of FcgammaRIIB and the chromosomal translocation of Y-linked autoimmune acceleration (Yaa) that hastens and results in a more aggressive lupuslike disease in these mice. The findings show that deficiency of IgE delays disease development and severity as demonstrated by reduced autoantibody production and amelioration of organ pathologies. This was associated with decreased numbers of plasma cells and reduced levels of IgG2b and IgG3. Unexpectedly, the loss of IgE also caused a striking decrease of immune cell infiltration in secondary lymphoid organs with a marked effect on the presence of dendritic cells, monocytes, neutrophils, and eosinophils in these organs and decreased activation of basophils. The presence of autoreactive IgE in human systemic lupus erythematosus subjects was also associated with increased basophil activation and enhanced disease activity. These findings argue that IgE facilitates the amplification of autoimmune inflammation."
778,"Short-term changes in hormonal profiles after laparoscopic ovarian laser evaporation compared with diagnostic laparoscopy for PCOS."
779,"STUDY QUESTION: Which reproductive endocrine changes are attributed exclusively to laparoscopic ovarian drilling in polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS)? SUMMARY ANSWER: Laser evaporation-specific endocrine effects were the prevention of an immediate increase in inhibin B and a sustained decrease in testosterone, androstenedione and anti-Mullarian hormone (AMH). WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: All ovarian drilling procedures result in reproductive endocrine changes. It is not known which of these changes are the result of ovarian drilling and which are related to the surgery per se. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: This prospective controlled study was performed at an outpatient academic fertility clinic. Between 2007 and 2010, a total of 21 oligo- or amenorrheic PCOS patients were included. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: Included were oligo- or amenorrheic PCOS patients with all three of the Rotterdam criteria and luteinizing hormone (LH) >6.5 U/l. All PCOS patients had an indication for diagnostic surgery due to subfertility. There were 12 PCOS patients who chose to undergo ovarian laser evaporation (CO2 laser, 25 W, 20 times/ovary) and 9 PCOS who chose a diagnostic laparoscopy only (controls). Reproductive endocrinology was measured before, and until 5 days after, surgery, and four gonadotrophin-releasing hormone (GnRH) 'double pulse' tests were included. The main outcome measures were changes in reproductive endocrinology and pituitary sensitivity/priming to GnRH after laser evaporation compared with diagnostic laparoscopy only. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: In the first hours after surgery, both groups showed an increase in LH, follicle stimulating hormone, estrogen and a decrease in testosterone, androstenedione, AMH and insulin growth factor-1 (P < 0.05). Inhibin B increased in the laparoscopy only group (P < 0.05). In the first days after surgery, testosterone, androstenedione and AMH remained at lower than baseline levels exclusively in the laser group (P < 0.05). Pituitary sensitivity/priming to GnRH was not altered after either laser evaporation or laparoscopy only. LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: The limitations of this study are the short follow-up period and the relatively small groups. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: The strength of this study is the integrally measured endocrine profiles in combination with an optimal control group of PCOS patients undergoing diagnostic laparoscopy only. Interestingly, most of the immediate endocrine changes after laser evaporation could be related to the surgical context and not to the ovarian drilling procedure itself. STUDY FUNDING/COMPETING INTERESTS: The study was funded by the Foundation of Scientific Research in Obstetrics and Gynaecology and the study medication, Lutrelef, was donated by Ferring, The Netherlands, Hoofdorphe There were no conflicts of interests mentioned by the authors."
780,"Lipid profiles and ovarian reserve status: a longitudinal study."
781,"STUDY QUESTION: Is there any association between ovarian reserve status and lipid profile changes? SUMMARY ANSWER: Women with lower ovarian reserve might be susceptible to higher cardiovascular risks, especially lipid disturbances, even during their reproductive life span. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: The risk of developing cardiovascular disease (CVD) in women increases after menopause, but the association between ovarian reserve status and CVD is not known. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE AND DURATION: This longitudinal study was conducted on 1015 participants of Tehran Lipid and Glucose Study, an ongoing population based cohort study with 12 years follow-up. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: There were 1015 women who were aged 20-50 years and met our eligibility criteria. Their ovarian reserve status was identified according to their age-specific AMH levels, calculated using the exponential-normal 3-parameter model. At the time of recruitment, 268, 233, 256 and 258 subjects were in the first, second, third and fourth quartiles of age-specific AMH, respectively. The cardiovascular risk factors of these groups were compared. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: Anthropometric measurements, lipid profiles and mean systolic and diastolic blood pressures in the first and fourth AMH quartiles did not differ at the initiation of the study. Total cholesterol (TC) net changes per year were incremental in the first AMH quartile but not in the fourth quartile (P < 0.001). According to the generalized estimating equation (GEE), after adjustment for age, BMI, time interaction and menopause status, the changes across time in TC, LDL and HDL were varied according to the age-specific AMH status. LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: A potential limitation is that development of cardiovascular risk is a major long-term event that needs decades of follow-up from birth to death; hence further studies with longer follow-up times are needed. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: We provide the insight that women with lower ovarian reserve might be susceptible to developing cardiovascular risk factors, particularly lipid disturbances, even during their reproductive life span. STUDY FUNDING/COMPETING INTERESTS: This study was funded by Research Institute for Endocrine Sciences, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences. The authors report no conflict of interest. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: Not applicable."
782,"Laser-assisted zona pellucida thinning does not facilitate hatching and may disrupt the in vitro hatching process: a morphokinetic study in the mouse."
783,"STUDY QUESTION: Does laser-assisted zona thinning of cleavage stage mouse embryos facilitate hatching in vitro? SUMMARY ANSWER: No, unlike laser zona opening, zona thinning does not facilitate embryo hatching. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: Artificial opening of the zona pellucida facilitates hatching of mouse and human embryos. Laser-assisted zona thinning has also been used for the purpose of assisted hatching of human embryos but it has not been properly investigated in an animal model; thinning methods have produced inconsistent clinical results. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: Time-lapse microscopy was used to study the hatching process in the mouse after zona opening and zona thinning; a control group of embryos was not zona-manipulated but exposed to the same laser energy. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: Eight-cell CB6F1/J mouse embryos were pooled and allocated to three groups (n = 56 per group): A control group of embryos that were exposed to a dose of laser energy focused outside the zona pellucida (zona intact); one experimental group of embryos in which the zona pellucida was opened by complete ablation using the same total number of pulses as the control group; a second experimental group of embryos in which the zona pellucida was thinned to establish a smooth lased area using the same number of pulses as used in the other two groups. The width of the zona opening was 25 mum and width of the thinned area was 35 mum. Development was monitored by time-lapse microscopy. Overall treatment differences for continuous variables were analyzed by analysis of variance and pairwise comparisons using the Student t-test allowing for unequal variances, while for categorical data, a standard chi-squared test was utilized for all pairwise comparisons. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: The frequency of complete hatching was 33.9% in the control group, 94.4% after zona opening, and 39.3% after zona thinning (overall group comparison, P < 0.0001). Overall, 60.7% of the zona-thinned embryos did not complete the hatching process and remained trapped within the zona; when they did hatch, they did not necessarily hatch from the zona-thinned area. Hatching in about one-third of the zona-intact embryos began with breaches at multiple sites by small groups of cells. Likewise, 53.6% of zona-thinned embryos had multiple breaches, always involving an area outside the thinned zone. Zona opening decreased multiple breaching and led to blastocyst escape an average of 14 h earlier than zona-thinned embryos and 5.5 h before control embryos (P = 0.0003). LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: The experiments presented here were limited to in vitro experiments performed in the mouse. Whether human embryos would behave the same way under similar circumstances is unknown. We postulate that zona thinning is not beneficial in human embryos. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: The experiments demonstrate that zona thinning is not equivalent to zona opening for assisted hatching. The study provides reason for systematic reviews of assisted hatching trials to take the method of assisted hatching into consideration and not combine the results of zona thinning and zona opening procedures. STUDY FUNDING/COMPETING INTERESTS: Institutional funds were used for the study. No competing interests are declared."
784,"Using cluster analysis to identify a homogeneous subpopulation of women with polycystic ovarian morphology in a population of non-hyperandrogenic women with regular menstrual cycles."
785,"STUDY QUESTION: Can cluster analysis can be used to identify a homogeneous subpopulation of women with polycystic ovarian morphology (PCOM) within a very large population of control women in a non-subjective way? SUMMARY ANSWER: Identification and exclusion of the cluster corresponding to women with PCOM from controls improved the diagnostic power of serum anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH) level and follicle number per ovary (FNPO) in discriminating between women with or without polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: There is disagreement as to whether women with PCOM should be excluded from the control population when establishing FNPO and AMH diagnostic thresholds for the definition of PCOS and how to identify such women. It has been demonstrated that cluster analysis can detect women with PCOM within the control population through a set of classifying variables among which the most relevant was AMH. The adequacy of this approach has not been confirmed in other clinical settings. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: This was a retrospective study using clinical and laboratory data derived from the computerized database. The data were collected from March 2011 to May 2013. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: The study included 893 patients referred for routine infertility evaluation and treatment. The patients were divided into three groups: (i) the control group (n = 621) included women with regular menstrual cycles and no signs of hyperandrogenism (HA), (ii) the full-blown PCOS group (n = 95) consisted of women who were diagnosed as having PCOS based on the presence of both HA and oligo/amenorrhoea (OA), (iii) the mild PCOS group included women with only two items of the Rotterdam classification, i.e. PCOM at ultrasonography according to the FNPO threshold of 12 or more and either OA (n = 110) or HA (n = 67). MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: After exclusion of women with PCOM from the controls, the AMH threshold of 28 pmol/l with specificity 97.5% and sensitivity 84.2% [area under the curve (AUC) 0.948 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.915-0.982)] and FNPO threshold of 12 with specificity 92.5% and sensitivity 83.2% [AUC 0.940 (95% CI 0.909-0.971)] for identifying PCOS were derived from the receiver operating characteristic curve analysis. The AMH threshold of 28 pmol/l had the same specificity for discriminating the mild and the full-blown PCOS phenotypes from controls. LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: There was no selection bias other than being evaluated for infertility treatment, however, this could also be considered as a limitation of the study as these women may not necessarily be a representative sample of the general population. The study demonstrated that serum AMH has intrinsically a very high potency to detect women with PCOM within a control group. However, the AMH threshold is specific for this method and clinical setting. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: AMH threshold value for the definition of PCOM is method specific and cannot be universally applied. This study confirmed the results of previous studies that cluster analysis can identify women with PCOM within the very large control population without using a predefined diagnostic threshold for FNPO, and that AMH can detect women with PCOM with a high specificity. The exclusion of PCOM women from the controls by using a cluster analysis should be considered when establishing reference intervals and decision threshold values for various parameters used to characterize PCOS. STUDY FUNDING/COMPETING INTERESTS: The authors have no funding/competing interest(s) to declare."
786,"Outcomes for patients with the same disease treated inside and outside of randomized trials: a systematic review and meta-analysis."
787,"BACKGROUND: It is unclear whether participation in a randomized controlled trial (RCT), irrespective of assigned treatment, is harmful or beneficial to participants. We compared outcomes for patients with the same diagnoses who did (""insiders"") and did not (""outsiders"") enter RCTs, without regard to the specific therapies received for their respective diagnoses. METHODS: By searching the MEDLINE (1966-2010), Embase (1980-2010), CENTRAL (1960-2010) and PsycINFO (1880-2010) databases, we identified 147 studies that reported the health outcomes of ""insiders"" and a group of parallel or consecutive ""outsiders"" within the same time period. We prepared a narrative review and, as appropriate, meta-analyses of patients' outcomes. RESULTS: We found no clinically or statistically significant differences in outcomes between ""insiders"" and ""outsiders"" in the 23 studies in which the experimental intervention was ineffective (standard mean difference in continuous outcomes -0.03, 95% confidence interval [CI] -0.1 to 0.04) or in the 7 studies in which the experimental intervention was effective and was received by both ""insiders"" and ""outsiders"" (mean difference 0.04, 95% CI -0.04 to 0.13). However, in 9 studies in which an effective intervention was received only by ""insiders,"" the ""outsiders"" experienced significantly worse health outcomes (mean difference -0.36, 95% CI -0.61 to -0.12). INTERPRETATION: We found no evidence to support clinically important overall harm or benefit arising from participation in RCTs. This conclusion refutes earlier claims that trial participants are at increased risk of harm."
788,"Raised levels of immunoglobulin G, A and M are associated with an increased risk of total and cause-specific mortality: the Vietnam Experience Study."
789,"BACKGROUND: Immunoglobulins (Ig) are essential for combating infectious disease. However, high levels are associated with a range of diseases and/or poor health behaviours, such as autoimmune diseases, chronic infection, HIV and excessive alcohol consumption. In the present analyses, we extend this body of work by examining whether higher levels of serum Ig G, A and M are associated with increased mortality risk. METHODS: Participants were 4255 Vietnam-era, former US army personnel (the Vietnam Experience Study). From military service files, telephone interviews in 1983 and a medical examination in 1986, sociodemographic, and health data were collected. Contemporary morning fasted blood samples were taken from which IgG, IgA and IgM concentrations were determined. Mortality surveillance over 15 years gave rise to deaths ascribed to all-causes, cardiovascular disease mortality, all cancers combined mortality, external cause and 'other' causes (predominantly comprising deaths due to infectious disease). Cox proportional hazard models were utilised to compute HRs per SD increase in Ig which were first adjusted for age and then additionally adjusting for a range of candidate confounders. RESULTS: In multiply adjusted analyses, in general, the higher the immunoglobulin concentration, the greater the risk of death. Thus, IgA (HR=2.0 95% CI 1.47 to 2.73), IgM (HR=1.5 95% CI 1.11 to 1.91) and IgG (HR=5.8 95% CI 3.38 to 9.95) were positively related to all-cause mortality. Corresponding results for 'other' causes of mortality were 4.7 (2.64 to 8.19), 3.5 (2.29 to 5.45) and 33.4 (15.13 to 73.64). CONCLUSIONS: In the present study, high levels of Ig are associated with an elevated risk of death from total and 'other' causes, mainly infectious disease. High levels of Ig, particularly IgG, may signal subclinical disease."
790,"Did Changes in Drug Reimbursement After the Medicare Modernization Act Affect Chemotherapy Prescribing?"
791,"PURPOSE: The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 (MMA) decreased fee-for-service (FFS) payments for outpatient chemotherapy. We assessed how this policy affected chemotherapy in FFS settings versus in integrated health networks (IHNs). PATIENTS AND METHODS: We examined 5,831 chemotherapy regimens for 3,613 patients from 2003 to 2006 with colorectal cancer (CRC) or lung cancers in the Cancer Care Outcomes Research Surveillance Consortium. Patients were from four geographically defined regions, seven large health maintenance organizations, and 15 Veterans Affairs Medical Centers. The outcome of interest was receipt of chemotherapy that included at least one drug for which reimbursement declined after the MMA. RESULTS: The odds of receiving an MMA-affected drug were lower in the post-MMA era: the odds ratio (OR) was 0.73 (95% CI, 0.59 to 0.89). Important differences across cancers were detected: for CRC, the OR was 0.65 (95% CI, 0.46 to 0.92); for non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), the OR was 1.60 (95% CI, 1.09 to 2.35); and for small-cell lung cancer, the OR was 0.63 (95% CI, 0.34 to 1.16). After the MMA, FFS patients were less likely to receive MMA-affected drugs: OR, 0.73 (95% CI, 0.59 to 0.89). No pre- versus post-MMA difference in the use of MMA-affected drugs was detected among IHN patients: OR, 1.01 (95% CI, 0.66 to 1.56). Patients with CRC were less likely to receive an MMA-affected drug in both FFS and IHN settings in the post- versus pre-MMA era, whereas patients with NSCLC were the opposite: OR, 1.60 (95% CI, 1.09 to 2.35) for FFS and 6.33 (95% CI, 2.09 to 19.11) for IHNs post- versus pre-MMA. CONCLUSION: Changes in reimbursement after the passage of MMA appear to have had less of an impact on prescribing patterns in FFS settings than the introduction of new drugs and clinical evidence as well as other factors driving adoption of new practice patterns."
792,"Phase I/II Study of the Antibody-Drug Conjugate Glembatumumab Vedotin in Patients With Locally Advanced or Metastatic Breast Cancer."
793,"PURPOSE: Glycoprotein NMB (gpNMB), a novel transmembrane protein overexpressed in 40% to 60% of breast cancers, promotes metastases in animal models and is a prognostic marker of a poor outcome in patients. The antibody-drug conjugate glembatumumab vedotin consists of a fully human anti-gpNMB monoclonal antibody, conjugated via a cleavable linker to monomethyl auristatin E. Glembatumumab vedotin is generally well tolerated, with observed objective responses in advanced melanoma. This is, to our knowledge, the first study of glembatumumab vedotin in breast cancer. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Eligible patients had advanced/metastatic breast cancer with at least two prior chemotherapy regimens, including taxane, anthracycline, and capecitabine. A standard 3+3 dose escalation was followed by a phase II expansion. Immunohistochemistry for gpNMB was performed retrospectively for patients with available tumor tissue. RESULTS: Forty-two patients were enrolled. Dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) consisted of worsening neuropathy at 1.34 mg/kg. After excluding patients with baseline neuropathy more than grade 1, no DLT occurred through 1.88 mg/kg (the phase II dose). The phase II primary activity end point was met (12-week progression-free survival [PFS12] = 9 of 27 patients; 33%). Sixteen of 19 (84%) patients tested had gpNMB-positive tumors. At the phase II dose, median PFS was 9.1 weeks for all patients, 17.9 weeks for patients with triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), and 18.0 weeks for patients with gpNMB-positive tumors. Two patients had confirmed partial responses; both had gpNMB-positive tumors and one had TNBC. CONCLUSION: Glembatumumab vedotin has an acceptable safety profile. Preliminary evidence of activity in treatment-resistant metastatic breast cancer requires confirmation, such as the phase II randomized trial (EMERGE) that also examines the relationship between activity and gpNMB distribution/intensity."
794,"Multi-Institutional Study of Post-Transplantation Cyclophosphamide As Single-Agent Graft-Versus-Host Disease Prophylaxis After Allogeneic Bone Marrow Transplantation Using Myeloablative Busulfan and Fludarabine Conditioning."
795,"PURPOSE: The clinical safety and efficacy of intravenous busulfan and fludarabine (IV Bu/Flu) myeloablative conditioning as well as graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis with high-dose, post-transplantation cyclophosphamide (PTCy) have been demonstrated independently in several single-institutional studies. We hypothesized that combining these two promising approaches in a multi-institutional study of human leukocyte antigen (HLA) -matched bone marrow transplantation would provide low rates of severe acute and chronic GVHD, low toxicity, and effective disease control. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Ninety-two adult patients (median age, 49 years; range, 21 to 65 years) with high-risk hematologic malignancies were enrolled at three centers (clinical trial No. NCT00809276). Forty-five patients received related allografts, and 47 received unrelated allografts. GVHD prophylaxis was solely with PTCy at 50 mg/kg/day on post-transplantation days +3 and +4. RESULTS: The cumulative incidences of grades 2 to 4 acute, grades 3 to 4 acute, and chronic GVHD were 51%, 15%, and 14%, respectively. Nonrelapse mortality (NRM) at 100 days and 1 year were 9% and 16%, respectively. With a median follow-up period of 2.2 years, the 2-year disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) rates were 62% and 67%, respectively. Donor relatedness did not affect NRM, DFS, or OS. Patients in complete remission (CR) without evidence of minimal residual disease (MRD) had markedly better DFS (80%) and OS (80%) than patients in CR with MRD or with active disease at the time of transplantation (DFS, P = .0005; OS, P = .019). CONCLUSION: This multi-institutional study demonstrates that PTCy can be safely and effectively combined with IV Bu/Flu myeloablative conditioning and confirms PTCy's efficacy as single-agent, short-course GVHD prophylaxis for both acute and chronic GVHD after bone marrow transplantation from HLA-matched donors."
796,"p16 Protein Expression and Human Papillomavirus Status As Prognostic Biomarkers of Nonoropharyngeal Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma."
797,"PURPOSE: Although p16 protein expression, a surrogate marker of oncogenic human papillomavirus (HPV) infection, is recognized as a prognostic marker in oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC), its prevalence and significance have not been well established in cancer of the oral cavity, hypopharynx, or larynx, collectively referred as non-OPSCC, where HPV infection is less common than in the oropharynx. PATIENTS AND METHODS: p16 expression and high-risk HPV status in non-OPSCCs from RTOG 0129, 0234, and 0522 studies were determined by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and in situ hybridization (ISH). Hazard ratios from Cox models were expressed as positive or negative, stratified by trial, and adjusted for clinical characteristics. RESULTS: p16 expression was positive in 14.1% (12 of 85), 24.2% (23 of 95), and 19.0% (27 of 142) and HPV ISH was positive in 6.5% (six of 93), 14.6% (15 of 103), and 6.9% (seven of 101) of non-OPSCCs from RTOG 0129, 0234, and 0522 studies, respectively. Hazard ratios for p16 expression were 0.63 (95% CI, 0.42 to 0.95; P = .03) and 0.56 (95% CI, 0.35 to 0.89; P = .01) for progression-free (PFS) and overall survival (OS), respectively. Comparing OPSCC and non-OPSCC, patients with p16-positive OPSCC have better PFS and OS than patients with p16-positive non-OPSCC, but patients with p16-negative OPSCC and non-OPSCC have similar outcomes. CONCLUSION: Similar to results in patients with OPSCC, patients with p16-negative non-OPSCC have worse outcomes than patients with p16-positive non-OPSCC, and HPV may also have a role in outcome in a subset of non-OPSCC. However, further development of a p16 IHC scoring system in non-OPSCC and improvement of HPV detection methods are warranted before broad application in the clinical setting."
798,"Cognitive Function After the Initiation of Adjuvant Endocrine Therapy in Early-Stage Breast Cancer: An Observational Cohort Study."
799,"PURPOSE: This report examines cognitive complaints and neuropsychological (NP) testing outcomes in patients with early-stage breast cancer after the initiation of endocrine therapy (ET) to determine whether this therapy plays any role in post-treatment cognitive complaints. PATIENTS AND METHODS: One hundred seventy-three participants from the Mind Body Study (MBS) observational cohort provided data from self-report questionnaires and NP testing obtained at enrollment (T1, before initiation of ET), and 6 months later (T2). Bivariate analyses compared demographic and treatment variables, cognitive complaints, depressive symptoms, quality of life, and NP functioning between those who received ET versus not. Multivariable linear regression models examined predictors of cognitive complaints at T2, including selected demographic variables, depressive symptoms, ET use, and other medical variables, along with NP domains that were identified in bivariate analyses. RESULTS: Seventy percent of the 173 MBS participants initiated ET, evenly distributed between tamoxifen or aromatase inhibitors. ET-treated participants reported significantly increased language and communication (LC) cognitive complaints at T2 (P = .003), but no significant differences in NP test performance. Multivariable regression on LC at T2 found higher LC complaints significantly associated with T1 LC score (P < .001), ET at T2 (P = .004), interaction between ET and past hormone therapy (HT) (P < .001), and diminished improvement in NP psychomotor function (P = .05). Depressive symptoms were not significant (P = .10). CONCLUSION: Higher LC complaints are significantly associated with ET 6 months after starting treatment and reflect diminished improvements in some NP tests. Past HT is a significant predictor of higher LC complaints after initiation of ET."
800,"Shorter-Duration Therapy Using Vincristine, Dactinomycin, and Lower-Dose Cyclophosphamide With or Without Radiotherapy for Patients With Newly Diagnosed Low-Risk Rhabdomyosarcoma: A Report From the Soft Tissue Sarcoma Committee of the Children's Oncology Group."
801,"PURPOSE: Intergroup Rhabdomyosarcoma Study Group (IRSG) studies III and IV showed improved failure-free survival (FFS) rates with vincristine, dactinomycin, and cyclophosphamide (VAC; total cumulative cyclophosphamide dose, 26.4 g/m2) compared with vincristine and dactinomycin (VA) for patients with subset-one low-risk embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma (ERMS; stage 1/2 group I/II ERMS or stage 1 group III orbit ERMS). The objective of Children's Oncology Group ARST0331 was to reduce the length of therapy without compromising FFS for this subset of low-risk patients by using VA in combination with lower-dose cyclophosphamide (total cumulative dose, 4.8 g/m2) plus radiotherapy (RT). PATIENTS AND METHODS: This noninferiority prospective clinical trial enrolled newly diagnosed patients with subset-one clinical features. Therapy included four cycles of VAC followed by four cycles of VA over 22 weeks. Patients with microscopic or gross residual disease at study entry received RT. RESULTS: With a median follow-up of 4.3 years, we observed 35 failures among 271 eligible patients versus 48.4 expected failures, calculated using a fixed outcome based on the FFS expected for similar patients treated on the IRSG D9602 protocol. The estimated 3-year FFS rate was 89% (95% CI, 85% to 92%), and the overall survival rate was 98% (95% CI, 95% to 99%). Patients with paratesticular tumors had the most favorable outcome. Three-year cumulative incidence rates for any local, regional, or distant failures were 7.6%, 1.5%, and 3.4%, respectively. CONCLUSION: Shorter-duration therapy that included lower-dose cyclophosphamide and RT did not compromise FFS for patients with subset-one low-risk ERMS."
802,"Utility of Routine Post-Therapy Surveillance Imaging in Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma."
803,"PURPOSE: We examined the utility of post-therapy surveillance imaging in a large, prospectively enrolled cohort of patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) from the United States and confirmed our results in an independent cohort of patients from France. METHODS: Patients with newly diagnosed DLBCL and treated with anthracycline-based immunochemotherapy were identified from the Molecular Epidemiology Resource (MER) of the University of Iowa/Mayo Clinic Lymphoma Specialized Program of Research Excellence and the Leon Berard Cancer Center, Lyon, France. In those with relapse, details at relapse and outcomes were abstracted from records. RESULTS: 680 individuals with DLBCL were identified from the MER, 552 (81%) of whom achieved remission after induction. 112 of the 552 patients (20%) suffered a relapse. The majority (64%) of relapses were identified before a scheduled follow-up visit. Surveillance imaging detected DLBCL relapse before clinical manifestations in nine out of 552 patients (1.6%) observed after therapy. In the Lyon cohort, imaging identified asymptomatic DLBCL relapse in four out of 222 patients (1.8%). There was no difference in survival after DLBCL relapse in patients detected at scheduled follow-up versus before scheduled follow-up in both the MER (P = .56) and Lyon cohorts (P = .25). CONCLUSION: The majority of DLBCL relapses are detected outside of planned follow-up, with no difference in outcome in patients with DLBCL detected at a scheduled visit compared with patients with relapse detected outside of planned follow-up. These data do not support the use of routine surveillance imaging for follow-up of DLBCL."
804,"Randomized Comparison of Gemcitabine, Dexamethasone, and Cisplatin Versus Dexamethasone, Cytarabine, and Cisplatin Chemotherapy Before Autologous Stem-Cell Transplantation for Relapsed and Refractory Aggressive Lymphomas: NCIC-CTG LY.12."
805,"PURPOSE: For patients with relapsed or refractory aggressive lymphoma, we hypothesized that gemcitabine-based therapy before autologous stem-cell transplantation (ASCT) is as effective as and less toxic than standard treatment. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We randomly assigned 619 patients with relapsed/refractory aggressive lymphoma to treatment with gemcitabine, dexamethasone, and cisplatin (GDP) or to dexamethasone, cytarabine, and cisplatin (DHAP). Patients with B-cell lymphoma also received rituximab. Responding patients proceeded to stem-cell collection and ASCT. Coprimary end points were response rate after two treatment cycles and transplantation rate. The noninferiority margin for the response rate to GDP relative to DHAP was set at 10%. Secondary end points included event-free and overall survival, treatment toxicity, and quality of life. RESULTS: For the intention-to-treat population, the response rate with GDP was 45.2%; with DHAP the response rate was 44.0% (95% CI for difference, -9.0% to 6.7%), meeting protocol-defined criteria for noninferiority of GDP (P = .005). Similar results were obtained in a per-protocol analysis. The transplantation rates were 52.1% with GDP and 49.3% with DHAP (P = .44). At a median follow-up of 53 months, no differences were detected in event-free survival (HR, 0.99; stratified log-rank P = .95) or overall survival (HR, 1.03; P = .78) between GDP and DHAP. Treatment with GDP was associated with less toxicity (P < .001) and need for hospitalization (P < .001), and preserved quality of life (P = .04). CONCLUSION: For patients with relapsed or refractory aggressive lymphoma, in comparison with DHAP, treatment with GDP is associated with a noninferior response rate, similar transplantation rate, event-free survival, and overall survival, less toxicity and hospitalization, and superior quality of life."
806,"Association of Electrocardiographic Left Ventricular Hypertrophy With Incident Cardiovascular Disease in Japanese Older Hypertensive Patients."
807,"BACKGROUND: Our aim was to assess whether electrocardiographic left ventricular hypertrophy (ECG-LVH) is associated with a higher risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) events, independent of 24-hour blood pressure (BP) and circulating levels of norepinephrine and hemostatic factors. METHODS: In 514 older hypertensive patients (mean age 72.3 years; 37% men), we assessed ambulatory BP values, circulating levels of norepinephrine and hemostatic factors (plasma fibrinogen, prothrombin fragment 1+2 (F1+2), von Willebrand factor (vWF), and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1)), and the presence or absence of ECG-LVH (Sokolow-Lyon voltage >/= 3.5 mV). The incidence of CVD events (i.e., myocardial infarction and stroke) was prospectively ascertained. RESULTS: During an average 41 months of follow-up (1,751 person-years), 43 stroke and 3 myocardial infarction events occurred. At baseline, patients with ECG-LVH had higher mean 24-hour BP (148.8/83.8mm Hg vs. 135.7/77.2mm Hg) and circulating norepinephrine levels (404.6 pg/ml vs. 336.3 pg/ml) compared to those without ECG-LVH; the differences remained unchanged after adjustment for age, gender, smoking status, presence of diabetes, and antihypertensive medication uses at follow-up time (all P < 0.01). Cox proportional hazards models suggested that the hazard ratio (HR; 95% confidence interval (CI)) of CVD events for those with ECG-LVH was 4.4 (2.3-8.2), and the association between ECG-LVH and incident CVD events remained significant after adjustment for high 24-hour BP (>/=130/80mm Hg), nocturnal SBP, circulating norepinephrine and fibrinogen levels (HRs, 3.5-4.2, all P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: In older hypertensive patients, ECG-LVH was associated with a higher risk of CVD events, independent of ambulatory BP parameters and circulating norepinephrine and fibrinogen levels."
808,"Impaired Fasting Glucose and Impaired Glucose Tolerance Do Not Predict Hypertension: A Community Cohort Study."
809,"BACKGROUND: Insulin resistance has an important role in the pathogenesis of hypertension. We hypothesized that impaired fasting glucose (IFG) or impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) which represents insulin resistance would predict the development of hypertension. METHODS: A total of 4,039 subjects without hypertension or diabetes (1,847 men and 2,192 women; age 49.9+/-8.2 years), from the Ansan-Ansung cohorts within the Korean Genome Epidemiology Study, were enrolled in 2001-2002 and restudied in 2005-2006. The association between the incidence of hypertension and IFG, IGT, or other metabolic factors was studied. RESULTS: During the 4-year follow-up period, 582 of the 4,039 subjects developed hypertension. At baseline, the prevalence of abdominal obesity, dyslipidemia, and IGT was higher in subjects who became hypertensive compared to those that remained normotensive. The prevalence of IFG was not significantly different between the 2 groups. In a multivariate analysis, abdominal obesity and high serum triglyceride were significant risk factors for the development of hypertension. Neither IFG nor IGT were significantly associated with new-onset hypertension. Although the risk of hypertension was higher with the number of metabolic components present at baseline, IFG and IGT were not significant components compared to other metabolic components, especially when abdominal obesity was taken into account. CONCLUSIONS: While metabolic syndrome components related to insulin resistance present at baseline are important risk factors of hypertension, we conclude that coexisting metabolic component, mainly abdominal obesity, rather than IFG and IGT have more predictive value for determining the development of hypertension in a Korean population."
810,"Acupuncture therapy for fever induced by viral upper respiratory tract infection (URTI) in military medical service: a case series."
811,"We report the cases of eight military patients with fever (>/=38 degrees C) induced by viral upper respiratory tract infection (URTI) who requested treatment with acupuncture in the military medical service room. All patients were treated immediately after diagnosis with classical acupuncture (GV14, GB20, TE8 points) and a new type of acupuncture, equilibrium acupuncture (Feibing and Ganmao points). After one treatment session (20 min), reduction of body temperature was confirmed in all patients. Accompanying symptoms such as headache, myalgia and nasal obstruction also showed a tendency to decrease. Within 3 days of treatment, six of the eight patients had recovered from the URTI. No adverse effects of acupuncture treatment were reported."
812,"Management of metastatic phaeochromocytoma and paraganglioma: use of Iodine-131-meta-iodobenzylguanidine (131I-MIBG) therapy in a tertiary referral centre."
813,"BACKGROUND: Phaeochromocytoma (phaeo) and paraganglioma (PGL) are rare conditions which are malignant in up to 30%. Optimal treatment is controversial but, in patients with metastatic 123I-MIBG avid tumours, we offer 131I-MIBG therapy. We summarise response rates, survival and safety in a cohort of such patients treated with 131I-MIBG in our centre from 1986 to 2012. DESIGN/METHODS: Retrospective analysis of the casenotes of patients with metastatic phaeo/PGL who received 131I-MIBG was undertaken; patients underwent clinical, biochemical and radiological evaluation within 6 months of each course of 131I-MIBG therapy. RESULTS: Twenty two patients (9 male) were identified, 12 with metastatic PGL and 10 with phaeo. Overall median follow up time after first dose of 131I-MIBG was 53 months. In total, 68 doses of 131I-MIBG were administered; average dose was 9967 MBq (269.4 mCi). After the first dose, >50% of patients demonstrated disease stability or partial response; progressive disease was seen in 9%. A subset of patients underwent repeated treatment with the majority demonstrating partial response or stable disease. No life threatening adverse events were reported but three patients developed hypothyroidism and two developed ovarian failure after repeated dosing. Five year survival after original diagnosis was 68% and median (+IQR) survival from date of diagnosis was 17 years (7.6-26.4) with no difference in survival according to diagnosis (p<0.1). CONCLUSIONS: 131I-MIBG is well tolerated and associates with disease stabilisation or improvement in the majority of patients with metastatic phaeo/PGL. However, stronger conclusions on treatment effectiveness are limited by lack of a directly comparable 'control group as well as an alternative 'gold standard' treatment."
814,"SRY Interference of Normal Regulation of the RET Gene Suggests a Potential Role of the Y-Chromosome Gene in Sexual Dimorphism in Hirschsprung Disease."
815,"The Hirschsprung disease (HSCR) is a complex congenital disorder, arising from abnormalities in enteric nervous system (ENS) development. There is a gender disparity among the patients, with the male to female ratio as high as 5:1. Loss-of-function mutations of HSCR genes and haploinsufficiency of their gene products are the primary pathogenic mechanisms for disease development. Recent studies identified over half of the HSCR disease susceptibility genes as targets for the sex-determining factor SRY, suggesting that this Y-encoded transcription factor could be involved in sexual dimorphism in HSCR. Among the SRY targets, the tyrosine kinase receptor RET represents the most important disease gene, whose mutations account for half of the familial and up to one-third of the sporadic forms of HSCR. RET is regulated by a distal and a proximal enhancer at its promoter, in which PAX3 and NKX2-1 are the resident transcription factors respectively. We show that the SRY-box 10 (SOX10) co-activator interacts and forms transcriptional complexes with PAX3 and NKX2-1 in a sequence-independent manner and exacerbates their respective transactivation activities on the RET promoter. SRY competitively displaces SOX10 in such transcription complexes and represses their regulatory functions on RET. Hence SRY could be a Y-located negative modifier of RET expression; and if it is ectopically expressed during ENS development, such SRY repression could result in RET protein haploinsufficiency and promotion of HSCR development, thereby contributing to sexual dimorphism in HSCR."
816,"Investigating Substrate-induced Motion between the Scaffold and Transport Domains in the Glutamate Transporter EAAT1."
817,"Excitatory amino acid transporter 1 (EAAT1) plays an important role in keeping the synaptic glutamate concentration below neurotoxic levels by translocating this neurotransmitter into the cell. Both reentrant hairpin loops, HP 1 and 2, have been shown to take part in binding the substrate and the more deeply buried sodium ion, and might therefore be a part of the intra- or extracellular gate of the transporter. However, the shape of the motion of either loop relative to transmembrane domain (TM) 4 during the transport cycle has not yet been fully resolved. Using Copper(II) (1,10-Phenanthroline)3 for crosslinking cysteine pairs, we found strong inhibition of transport when A243C (TM4) was combined with S366C (HP1), I453C (HP2) or T456C (HP2). These findings were reinforced by the impact of cadmium on transport activity, and both approaches consistently showed that proximity was exclusively intra-monomeric. Under conditions that promote the inward-facing state, inhibition by CuPh in A243C/S366C was reduced, while the opposite was seen when the outward-facing one was stabilized suggesting that the two positions are farther apart in the former conformation than in the latter. Surprisingly, maximal crosslinking of A243C with I453C or T456C was not observed under conditions that promote the inward-facing state. Altogether, our data suggest that the transporter may undergo complex relative movement between these positions on TM4 and HP1/HP2 during the transport cycle."
818,"Incidence of Cancer and Mortality in Patients from the Simvastatin and Ezetimibe in Aortic Stenosis (SEAS) Trial."
819,"The Simvastatin and Ezetimibe in Aortic Stenosis (SEAS) clinical trial, including 1,873 patients found an increased risk for cancer with lipid-lowering therapy with ezetimibe/simvastatin 10/40 mg/day, relative to placebo. In a registry-based follow-up study over 21 months from the conclusion of the SEAS trial, new incident cancer and total mortality were investigated in the SEAS study cohort from Denmark, Finland, Norway, Sweden, and the United Kingdom. Among 1,359 subjects eligible for follow-up (73% of the original total cohort), 1,194 had no history of cancer (primary follow-up cohort). New cancers and deaths were identified in the national cancer and mortality registries and classified by an Expert Review Committee. Data were analyzed using Cox proportional-hazards models of new cancers and mortality during follow-up according to treatment group assigned in the SEAS base study and with age, gender, smoking history, and previous cancers as covariates. The primary follow-up cohort had 12 patients with new cancers in the ezetimibe/simvastatin group and 22 in the placebo group (hazard ratio 0.55, 95% confidence interval 0.27 to 1.11), indicating no significant difference between the treatment groups. During follow-up, 43 patients assigned to ezetimibe/simvastatin and 33 assigned to placebo died (hazard ratio 1.29, 95% confidence interval 0.82 to 2.03). In conclusion, in this registry-based observational follow-up study of the original SEAS study patient population, treatment with ezetimibe/simvastatin was not associated with an increased risk for cancer or mortality in the 21-month period after the completion of the original SEAS study."
820,"The EADC-ADNI Harmonized Protocol for manual hippocampal segmentation on magnetic resonance: Evidence of validity."
821,"BACKGROUND: An international Delphi panel has defined a harmonized protocol (HarP) for the manual segmentation of the hippocampus on MR. The aim of this study is to study the concurrent validity of the HarP toward local protocols, and its major sources of variance. METHODS: Fourteen tracers segmented 10 Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) cases scanned at 1.5 T and 3T following local protocols, qualified for segmentation based on the HarP through a standard web-platform and resegmented following the HarP. The five most accurate tracers followed the HarP to segment 15 ADNI cases acquired at three time points on both 1.5 T and 3T. RESULTS: The agreement among tracers was relatively low with the local protocols (absolute left/right ICC 0.44/0.43) and much higher with the HarP (absolute left/right ICC 0.88/0.89). On the larger set of 15 cases, the HarP agreement within (left/right ICC range: 0.94/0.95 to 0.99/0.99) and among tracers (left/right ICC range: 0.89/0.90) was very high. The volume variance due to different tracers was 0.9% of the total, comparing favorably to variance due to scanner manufacturer (1.2), atrophy rates (3.5), hemispheric asymmetry (3.7), field strength (4.4), and significantly smaller than the variance due to atrophy (33.5%, P < .001), and physiological variability (49.2%, P < .001). CONCLUSIONS: The HarP has high measurement stability compared with local segmentation protocols, and good reproducibility within and among human tracers. Hippocampi segmented with the HarP can be used as a reference for the qualification of human tracers and automated segmentation algorithms."
822,"Radiation exposure to anaesthetists during endovascular procedures."
823,"Medical radiation exposure increases the likelihood of cataract formation. A personal dosimeter was attached to the left temple of 77 anaesthetists during 45 endovascular aortic aneurysm repairs and 32 interventional neuroradiology procedures. Compared with interventional neuroradiology, the median (IQR [range]) total radiation dose emitted by fluoroscopic equipment was significantly lower during endovascular aortic aneurysm repair (4175 (3127-5091 [644-9761]) mGy than interventional neuroradiology (1420 (613-2424 [165-10 840]) mGy, p < 0.001). However, radiation exposure to the anaesthetist's temple was significantly greater during endovascular aortic aneurysm repair (15 (6-41 [1-109]) muSv) than interventional neuroradiology (4 (2-8 [0-67]) muSv, p < 0.001). These data suggest that anaesthetists at our institution would have to deliver anaesthesia for ~1300 endovascular aortic aneurysm repairs and ~5000 interventional neuroradiology cases annually to exceed the general occupational limits, and ~10 000 endovascular aortic aneurysm repairs and ~37 500 interventional neuroradiology cases to exceed the ocular exposure limits recommended by the International Commission on Radiological Protection. Nevertheless, anaesthetists should be aware of the risk of ocular radiation exposure, and reduce this by limiting the time of exposure, increasing the distance from the source of radiation, and shielding."
824,"Quantitative Susceptibility Mapping: Current Status and Future Directions."
825,"Quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) is a new technique for quantifying magnetic susceptibility. It has already found various applications in quantifying in vivo iron content, calcifications and changes in venous oxygen saturation. The accuracy of susceptibility mapping is dependent on several factors. In this review, we evaluate the entire process of QSM from data acquisition to individual data processing steps. We also show preliminary results of several new concepts introduced in this review in an attempt to improve the quality and accuracy for certain steps. The uncertainties in estimating susceptibility differences using susceptibility maps, phase images, and T2* maps are analyzed and compared. Finally, example clinical applications are presented. We conclude that QSM holds great promise in quantifying iron and becoming a standard clinical tool."
826,"Simulation study of the effect of golden-angle KWIC with generalized kinetic model analysis on diagnostic accuracy for lesion discrimination."
827,"PURPOSE: To quantitatively evaluate temporal blurring of dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI data generated using a k-space weighted image contrast (KWIC) image reconstruction technique with golden-angle view-ordering. METHODS: K-space data were simulated using golden-angle view-ordering and reconstructed using a KWIC algorithm with a Fibonacci number of views enforced for each annulus in k-space. Temporal blurring was evaluated by comparingpharmacokinetic model parameters estimated from the simulated data with the true values. Diagnostic accuracy was quantified using receiver operator characteristic curves (ROC) and the area under the ROC curves (AUC). RESULTS: Estimation errors of pharmacokinetic model parameters were dependent on the true curve type and the lesion size. For 10mm benign and malignant lesions, estimated AUC values using the true and estimate AIFs were consistent with the true AUC value. For 5mm benign and 20mm malignant lesions, estimated AUC values using the true and estimated AIFs were 0.906+/-0.020 and 0.905+/-0.021, respectively, as compared with the true AUC value of 0.896. CONCLUSIONS: Although the investigated reconstruction algorithm does impose errors in pharmacokinetic model parameter estimation, they are not expected to significantly impact clinical studies of diagnostic accuracy."
828,"Yogurt for treating acute gastroenteritis in children: Systematic review and meta-analysis."
829,"BACKGROUND: In May 2014, the updated guidelines for the management of acute gastroenteritis (AGE) were published. The use of yogurt in the nutritional management of AGE was not addressed, although it is frequently used in many countries for this purpose. We aimed to systematically evaluate the efficacy of yogurt consumption for the management of AGE in children. DESIGN: In this systematic review, a number of databases, including MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library, with no language restrictions, were searched up to July 2014 for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating the effect of yogurt consumption in children with AGE. The risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane risk of bias tool. RESULTS: Four RCTs (n = 448) that were generally low in methodological quality, all performed in hospital setting, were included. Compared with placebo/no intervention, yogurt consumption had no significant effect on stool volume. The data on the effect of yogurt consumption on the duration of diarrhea and stool frequency were not consistent. The chance of treatment success (or failure) was similar in both groups. Compared with placebo, the duration of hospitalization was shorter in children who received yogurt, but the difference was of a borderline significance. Total weight gain increased for those treated with yogurt. CONCLUSIONS: The consumption of yogurt had a positive effect on weight gain, but no consistent effect on AGE outcomes in hospitalized children. Given the limited data and the methodological limitations of the included trials, the evidence should be viewed with caution. The effect of yogurt consumption in the ambulatory setting is unknown."
830,"The Role of Gender and Distance Mentoring in the Surgical Education Research Fellowship."
831,"OBJECTIVE: The nature of the mentor-mentee relationship is important in the pursuit of successful research projects. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the mentor-mentee relationships in the Surgical Education Research Fellowship (SERF) based on gender and geographical distances regarding program completion. We hypothesize that there are no differences for SERF program completion rates based on gender pairs and distances between pairs. METHODS: This was a retrospective study from 2006 to 2011. Mentor-mentee rosters were retrospectively reviewed for program completion, demographics, and PubMeD indexing. Time zone differences and geographic distances between pairs were found with online applications. Chi-square tests were used for categorical variables and nonparametric statistics were carried out using alpha = 0.05. RESULTS: Of the 82 individuals accepted into the SERF program, 43 (52%) completed the SERF program during the study period. There were no differences in program completion rates based on fellow gender and gender pairing (all p > 0.05). Different-gender pairs that completed the program (n = 17) were indexed more frequently on PubMed than same-gender pairs that completed the program (n = 24) (41% vs 12%, p = 0.04). There were no differences in program completion based on time zone differences (p = 0.20). The median distance between pairs completing the program (n = 35) was greater than that for pairs not completing the program (n = 36) (1741km [IQR: 895-3117km] vs 991km [IQR: 676-2601km]; p = 0.03). CONCLUSION: Completion of the SERF program was independent of mentor-mentee gender pairs and time zone differences. There was greater geographical distance separating mentor-mentee pairs that completed the SERF program compared with pairs that did not complete the program. Distance mentoring is a successful and crucial element of the SERF program."
832,"Vocal fold paralysis: Improved adductor recovery by vincristine blockade of posterior cricoarytenoid."
833,"OBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESIS: A new treatment for acute unilateral vocal-fold paralysis (UVFP) was proposed in which a drug is injected into the posterior cricoarytenoid muscle (PCA) shortly after nerve injury, before the degree of natural recovery is known, to prevent antagonistic synkinetic reinnervation. This concept was tested in a series of canine experiments using vincristine as the blocking agent. STUDY DESIGN: Animal experiments. METHODS: Laryngeal adductor function was measured at baseline and at 6 months following experimental recurrent laryngeal nerve (RLN) injuries, including complete transection, crush injury, and cautery. In the treatment animals, the PCA was injected with vincristine at the time of RLN injury. RESULTS: Adductor function in the vincristine-treated hemilarynges was significantly improved compared with injury-matched noninjected controls (total n = 43). Transection/repair controls recovered 56.1% of original adductor strength; vincristine-treated hemilarynges recovered to 73.1% (P = 0.002). Cautery injuries also improved with vincristine block (60.7% vs. 88.7%; P = 0.031). Crush injuries recovered well even without vincristine (104.8% vs. 111.2%; P = 0.35). CONCLUSION: These findings support a new paradigm of early, preemptive blockade of the antagonist muscle (PCA) to improve ultimate net adductor strength, which could potentially improve functional recovery in many UVFP patients and avoid the need for medialization procedures. Possible clinical aspects of this new approach are discussed. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: N/A. Laryngoscope, 2014."
834,"The Mini-Mental State Examination as a diagnostic and screening test for delirium: systematic review and meta-analysis."
835,"OBJECTIVE: To analyse the evidence concerning the accuracy of the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) as a diagnostic and screening test for the presence of delirium in adults. METHOD: Two authors searched MEDLINE, PsychINFO and EMBASE from inception till March 2014. Articles were included that investigated the diagnostic validity of the MMSE to detect delirium against standardised criteria. A diagnostic validity meta-analysis was conducted. RESULTS: Thirteen studies were included representing 2017 patients in medical settings of whom 29.4% had delirium. The meta-analysis revealed the MMSE had an overall sensitivity and specificity estimate of 84.1% and 73.0%, but this was 81.1% and 82.8% in a subgroup analysis involving robust high quality studies. Sensitivity was unchanged but specificity was 68.4% (95% CI=50.9-83.5%) in studies using a predefined cutoff of <24 to signify a case. In high-risk samples where delirium was present in 25% of patients, then the Positive predictive value and Negative predictive value would be 50.9% (48.3-66.2%) and 93.2% (90.0-96.5%). CONCLUSION: The MMSE cannot be recommended as a case-finding confirmatory test of delirium, but may be used as an initial screen to rule out high scorers who are unlikely to have delirium with approximately 93% accuracy."
836,"Aortic Valve Replacement Reduces Valvuloarterial Impedance but Does Not Affect Systemic Arterial Compliance in Elderly Men with Degenerative Calcific Trileaflet Aortic Valve Stenosis."
837,"OBJECTIVE: Standard methods of quantifying aortic valve stenosis (AS), which focus entirely on the valve itself, do not adequately characterize the magnitude, predict the onset, progression, and severity of symptoms, or identify the incidence of subsequent adverse events. Valvuloarterial impedance (Zva) is an index of global left ventricular (LV) afterload that incorporates valvular and arterial loads. The authors tested the hypothesis that aortic valve replacement (AVR) reduces Zva but does not affect the arterial component of LV afterload in elderly patients with degenerative calcific trileaflet AS. DESIGN: Observational study. SETTING: Veterans affairs medical center. PARTICIPANTS: Eight elderly (age, 79+/-4 years) men with moderate-to-severe AS and normal preoperative LV function (ejection fraction, 61%+/-9%) scheduled for AVR with or without coronary artery bypass graft surgery were studied after institutional review board approval. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: A comprehensive TEE examination was performed during isoflurane-fentanyl-rocuronium anesthesia. Doppler echocardiography was used to measure pressure gradients across the aortic valve, stroke volume (continuity equation), and aortic valve area using standard techniques. Zva was determined as (systolic arterial pressure+mean gradient)/stroke volume index. Energy loss index was calculated as (aortic areaxaortic valve area)/([aortic area - aortic valve area]xbody surface area). The stroke work loss was obtained as (mean gradientx100/[systolic arterial pressure+mean gradient]). The ratio of stroke volume index to pulse pressure was used to measure systemic arterial compliance. Zva, energy loss index, stroke work loss, and systemic arterial compliance were assessed before and 15 minutes after cardiopulmonary bypass. Systemic and pulmonary hemodynamics (invasive catheters) were similar after versus before AVR. Aortic valve area increased significantly (p<0.05) with AVR (0.92+/-0.26 cm2 to 1.94+/-0.35 cm2), concomitant with decreases in peak and mean gradients (60+/-17 mmHg to 15+/-8 mmHg and 38+/-11 mmHg to 8+/-5 mmHg, respectively) and peak blood flow velocity (3.9+/-0.5 m.s-1 to 1.9+/-0.5 m.s-1). AVR reduced Zva (4.6+/-1.0 mmHg.mL-1.m-2 to 3.5+/-0.3 mmHg.mL-1.m-2) and improved energy loss index (0.55+/-0.16 cm2.m-2 to 1.58+/-0.48 cm2.m-2) concomitant with a decline in stroke work loss (25%+/-6% to 7%+/-4%), but systemic arterial compliance remained unchanged (0.63+/-0.13 compared with 0.70+/-0.12 mL.mmHg-1.m-2). CONCLUSION: The current results showed that AVR acutely reduced Zva, improved energy loss index, and decreased stroke work loss, but did not affect systemic arterial compliance in elderly men with degenerative calcific trileaflet AS."
838,"Analysis of Vascular Closure Devices After Transbrachial Artery Access."
839,"INTRODUCTION: We seek to determine whether vascular closure devices (VCDs) are safe and effective for brachial artery access. METHODS: A retrospective review of brachial artery access using either manual compression (MC) or a VCD for hemostasis from November 2005 to February 2011 was performed. RESULTS: Brachial artery access was performed on 154 limbs: MC on 134 limbs and VCD on 20 limbs. The incidence of thrombotic (VCD n = 0 [0%] vs MC n = 7 [5.2%], P = .37), hemorrhagic complications (VCD n = 1 [5%] vs MC n = 7 [5.2%], P = .72), or major adverse events (VCD n = 1 [5%] vs MC n = 16 [12%], P = .32) was not significantly different between the techniques. After univariate and multivariate analysis, female sex (P = .07, relative risk [RR] = 5.7), sheath size > 6F (P = .008, RR = 14.6), and diagnostic versus interventional procedure (P = .04, RR = 0.4) all impacted the occurrence of thrombosis. CONCLUSIONS: Use of VCD in the brachial artery following an endovascular procedure showed equivalence to MC."
840,"Penicillinase-producing plasmid types of Neisseria gonorrhoeae clinical isolates from Australia."
841,"Penicillinase-producing Neisseria gonorrhoeae (PPNG) carrying the blaTEM-135 gene is of particular concern as it is considered a stepping stone towards resistance to extended spectrum cephalosporins. Here, we sought to characterise plasmid types and the occurrence of the blaTEM-135 gene for N. gonorrhoeae clinical isolates from Australia. We found that blaTEM-135 was prevalent in Australian PPNG and could be detected on all three major plasmid types."
842,"Spectrum of Activity and Mechanisms of Resistance of Various Nucleoside Derivatives against gamma-herpesviruses."
843,"The susceptibility of gamma-herpesviruses, including Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) and animal rhadinoviruses, to various nucleoside analogs was investigated in this report. Besides examining the antiviral activity and mode of action of antivirals currently marketed for the treatment of alpha- and/or beta-herpesvirus infections (including acyclovir, ganciclovir, penciclovir, foscarnet, brivudin), we also investigated the structure-activity relationship of various 5-substituted uridine and cytidine molecules. The antiviral efficacy of nucleoside derivatives bearing substitutions at the 5-position was decreased if the bromovinyl was replaced by chlorovinyl. BVaraU, a nucleoside with an arabinose configuration of the sugar ring, exhibited no inhibitory effect against rhadinoviruses, but was active against EBV. On the other hand, the fluoroarabinose cytidine analog FIAC showed high selectivity indices against gamma-herpesviruses that were comparable to those of brivudin. Additionally, we selected brivudin- and acyclovir-resistant rhadinoviruses in vitro and characterized them by phenotypic and genotypic (i.e. sequencing of the viral thymidine kinase, protein kinase and DNA polymerase) analysis. Here, we reveal key amino acids in these enzymes that play an important role in substrate's recognition. Our data on drug-susceptibility profiles of the different animal gamma-herpesvirus mutants highlighted cross-resistance patterns and indicated that pyrimidine nucleoside derivatives are phosphorylated by the viral thymidine kinase and purine nucleosides are preferentially activated by the gamma-herpesvirus protein kinase."
844,"Potency and Resistance Analysis of Hepatitis C Virus NS5B Polymerase Inhibitor BMS-791325 on All Major Genotypes."
845,"BMS-791325 is a Hepatitis C virus (HCV) inhibitor binding to the thumb domain of the NS5B RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. BMS-791325 is well characterized in genotype (GT) 1 and exhibits good inhibitory activity (EC50 < 10 nM) against hybrid replicons containing patient NS5B sequences from GT3a, 4a, and 5a while potency against GT2 is significantly reduced (l). BMS-791325 potency against GT6a hybrid replicons is more variable, with two of three hybrid clones having EC50 values similar to GT1 while a third patient clone was approximately 10 times less susceptible to BMS-791325. To characterize the resistance profile of BMS-791325 beyond GT1, curing studies were performed across GT1a, 3a-6a and demonstrated that GT1a has the highest resistance barrier versus BMS-791325 while GT6a has the lowest. Selection of GT3-6 NS5B chimeric replicon cells at different concentrations of BMS-791325 revealed substitutions in the thumb domain of NS5B at residues 494 and 495 that conferred different levels of resistance to BMS-791325 but remained susceptible to NS5A or NS3 protease inhibitors. In addition, we demonstrate the reduced potency of BMS-791325 against one GT6a patient is due to an A494 polymorphism present in approximately 21% of sequences in the European HCV database. The results from this report suggest that BMS-791325 is a candidate for combination treatment of HCV GT3-6 chronic infections and the resistance profiles identified will provide useful information for future clinical development."
846,"Effect of fluorescent dyes on in-vitro differentiated, late-stage Plasmodium falciparum gametocytes."
847,"Plasmodium falciparum gametocytes are not associated with clinical symptoms but they are responsible for transmitting the pathogen to mosquitoes. Therefore gametocytocidal interventions are important for malaria control and resistance containment but currently available drugs and vaccines are not well suited for that purpose. Several dyes have potent antimicrobial activity but their use against gametocytes has not been investigated systematically. Gametocytocidal activity of nine synthetic dyes and four compounds with known activity was tested against stage V gametocytes of the laboratory strain 3D7 and three clinical isolates of P. falciparum with a bioluminescence assay. Five of the fluorescent dyes had 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) values at sub-micromolar concentration against mature gametocytes. Three mitochondrial dyes: MitoRed, DiOC6 and rhodamine B were highly active (IC50 < 200 nM). MitoRed showed the highest activity against gametocytes with an IC50 of 70 nM against 3D7 and 120-210 nM against clinical isolates. All compounds were more active in the laboratory strain 3D7 in comparison with clinical isolates. In particular, the endoperoxides artesunate and dihydroartemisinin showed a 10-fold higher activity in 3D7 compared to clinical isolates. In contrast to all clinically used antimalarials, several fluorescent dyes had a surprisingly high in vitro activity against late stage gametocytes. Since they also act against asexual blood stages, they shall be considered as starting points for the development of new antimalarial lead compounds."
848,"Genome Sequencing of an Extended Series of NDM-Klebsiella pneumoniae Neonatal Infections in a Nepali Hospital Characterizes the Extent of Community Versus Hospital-associated Transmission in an Endemic Setting."
849,"BACKGROUND: NDM-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae represent a major clinical and infection control challenge, particularly in resource-limited settings with high rates of antimicrobial resistance. Determining whether transmission occurs at a gene, plasmid or bacterial strain level, within hospital and/or the community, has implications for monitoring and controlling spread. Whole genome sequencing (WGS) is the highest-resolution typing method available for transmission epidemiology. METHODS: We sequenced carbapenem-resistant K. pneumoniae isolates from 26 individuals involved in several infection case clusters in a Nepali neonatal unit, and 68 other clinical Gram-negative isolates from a similar timeframe, using Illumina and PacBio technologies. Within-outbreak chromosomal and closed plasmid structures were generated, and used as dataset-specific references. RESULTS: Three temporally separated case clusters were caused by a single NDM-K. pneumoniae strain, with a conserved set of four plasmids, one being a 304,526bp blaNDM-1-plasmid. The plasmids contained a large number of antimicrobial/heavy metal resistance and plasmid maintenance genes, which may have explained persistence. No obvious environmental/human reservoir was found. There was no evidence of transmission of outbreak plasmids to other Gram-negative clinical isolates, although blaNDM variants were present in other isolates in different genetic contexts. CONCLUSIONS: WGS can effectively define complex antimicrobial resistance epidemiology. Wider sampling frames are required to contextualize outbreaks. Infection control may be effective in terminating outbreaks caused by particular strains, even in areas with widespread resistance, although this study could not demonstrate evidence supporting specific interventions. Larger, detailed studies are needed to characterize resistance genes, vectors and host strains involved in disease, to enable effective intervention."
850,"Complex polymorphisms in the Plasmodium falciparum Multidrug Resistance Protein 2 gene and its contribution to antimalarial response."
851,"Plasmodium falciparum has the capacity to escape essentially all antimalarial drugs action. ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter proteins are known to be causative of multidrug resistance in a large range of organisms, including the Apicomplexa parasites. P. falciparum genome analysis has revealed two genes coding for Multidrug Resistance Protein (MRP) type of ABC transporters: Pfmrp1, previously associated with decreased parasite drug susceptibility, and the poorly studied Pfmrp2. The role of Pfmrp2 polymorphisms in modulating sensitivity to antimalarial drugs has not been established. We herein report a comprehensive account of the Pfmrp2 genetic variability in 46 Thai isolates. A notably high frequency of 2.8 single nucleotide polimorphisms (SNPs)/Kb was identified in this gene, with some SNPs being novel. Additionally, we also report that Pfmrp2 harbours a significant number of micro-indels, some previously not reported. We then investigated the potential association of the identified Pfmrp2 polymorphisms with altered in vitro susceptibility to several antimalarials used in the artemisinin based combination therapy and with the parasite clearance time. Association analysis suggested Pfmrp2 polymorphisms to modulate the parasite in vitro response to quinoline antimalarials, including chloroquine, piperaquine and mefloquine and association with in vivo parasite clearance. In conclusion, our study reveals that the Pfmrp2 gene is the most diverse ABC transporter known in P. falciparum with a potential role in antimalarial drug resistance."
852,"Sensitization of Intracellular Salmonella to Aminoglycosides in vitro and in vivo by a Host-Targeted Antimicrobial Agent."
853,"Aminoglycosides exhibit relatively poor activity against intracellular Salmonella due to their low permeability across eukaryotic cell membranes. Previously, we identified the unique ability of AR-12, a celecoxib-derived small-molecule agent, to eradicate intracellular Salmonella Typhimurium in macrophages by facilitating autophagosome formation and suppressing Akt kinase signaling. In light of this unique mode of antibacterial action, we investigated the ability of AR-12 to sensitize intracellular Salmonella to aminoglycosides in macrophages and in an animal model. The antibacterial activities of AR-12 combined with various aminoglycosides, including streptomycin, kanamycin, gentamicin and amikacin, against intracellular S. Typhimurium in murine RAW264.7 macrophages were assessed. Cells were infected with S. Typhimurium followed by treatment with AR-12, individual aminoglycoside, or in combination for 24 hours. The in vivo efficacies of AR-12, alone or in combination with gentamicin or amikacin, were also assessed by treating S. Typhimurium-infected Balb/c mice daily for 14 consecutive days. Exposure of S. Typhimurium-infected RAW264.7 cells to a combination of AR-12 with individual aminoglycosides led to a greater reduction in bacterial survival (P < 0.05), both intracellular and extracellular, relative to aminoglycosides alone. This sensitizing effect, however, was not associated with increased aminoglycoside penetration into bacteria or macrophages. Moreover, daily intraperitoneal injection of AR-12 at 0.1 mg/kg significantly increased the in vivo efficacy of gentamicin and amikacin in prolonging the survival of S. Typhimurium-infected mice. These findings indicate that the unique ability of AR-12 to enhance the in vivo efficacy of aminoglycosides might have translational potential to develop novel strategies for the treatment of salmonellosis."
854,"The Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics of (+) and (-) Primaquine Enantiomers in Rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta)."
855,"Primaquine (PQ) remains the sole available drug to prevent relapse of P. vivax malaria after more than 60 years. While administered as a racemic mixture, prior studies suggested a pharmacodynamic advantage based on differential anti-relapse activity and/or toxicities of its enantiomers. Oral primaquine enantiomers prepared using a novel easily scalable method were given for 7 days to healthy Rhesus macaques in dose-rising fashion to evaluate effects on the blood, liver and kidneys. The enantiomers were then administered to Plasmodium cynomolgi infected Rhesus at doses of 1.3 and 0.6 mg/kg/day in combination with chloroquine. The (-) PQ primaquine enantiomer had higher clearance and apparent volume of distribution compared to (+) PQ, and was more extensively converted to the carboxy metabolite. There evidence for differential oxidative stress with a concentration-dependent rise in methemoglobin with increasing doses of (+) PQ greater than that seen for (-) PQ. There was a marked, reversible hepatotoxicity in 2 of 3 animals dosed with (-) PQ at 4.5 mg/kg. (-) PQ, in combination with chloroquine was successful in preventing P. cynomolgi relapse at doses of 0.6 and 1.3 mg/kg, while 1 of 2 animals receiving (+) PQ at 0.6 mg/kg/d relapsed. While (-) PQ was also associated with hepatotoxicity at higher doses as seen previously, this has not been identified as clinical concern in humans over 60+ years of use. Limited evidence for increased MetHgb generation with the (+) form in the Rhesus model suggests it may be possible to improve the therapeutic window for hematologic toxicity in the clinic by separating primaquine into its enantiomers."
856,"A Beneficial Effect of Oral Tigecycline Treatment on Clostridium difficile Infection in Gnotobiotic Piglets."
857,"The efficacy of oral tigecycline treatment (2mg/kg for 7 days) on Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) was evaluated in the gnotobiotic pig model, and its effect on human gut microflora transplanted into the gnotobiotic pig was determined. Tigecycline oral treatment improved survival, clinical signs and lesion severity, and markedly decreased concentrations of Firmicutes, but did not promote CDI. Our data showed that oral tigecycline treatment has a potential beneficial effect on the treatment of CDI."
858,"New colistin population pharmacokinetic data in critically ill patients suggesting an alternative loading dose rational."
859,"BACKGROUND: Colistin is an old antibiotic that has recently gained a considerable renew of interest as the last line defense therapy against Multi Drug Resistant Gram-negative bacteria. It is administered as colistin methanesulfonate (CMS), an inactive prodrug, and it was shown that due to slow CMS conversion, colistin plasma concentrations increase very slowly after treatment initiation, which constitutes the rational for a loading dose in critically ill patients. Yet faster CMS conversion was observed in healthy volunteers, but using a different CMS brand, which may also have a major impact on colistin pharmacokinetics. METHODS: Seventy-three (73) critically ill patients non under dialysis received multiple dosing of CMS. Concentrations were measured by LC-MS/MS and a pharmacokinetic analysis was conducted using a population approach. RESULTS: We confirmed that CMS renal clearance and colistin concentrations at steady-state are mostly governed by creatinine clearance, but we predict a typical Cmax of colistin close 2 mg/L, occurring 3 hours after an initial 2 MIU CMS dose. Accordingly colistin t1/2 estimate was relatively short (3.1 h) and steady-state rapidly reached. CONCLUSIONS: Our results are only partially consistent with those recently published. We confirm that CMS maintenance dose should be adjusted to renal function in critically ill patients. However much higher than expected colistin concentrations were observed after the initial CMS dose with rapid steady-state achievement. These discrepancies challenge the pharmacokinetic rationale for a loading dose which may still be appropriate for rapid bacteria eradication and improved clinical cure rate."
860,"Autoreactive T cells specific for insulin B:11-23 recognize a low-affinity peptide register in human subjects with autoimmune diabetes."
861,"Previous studies in type 1 diabetes (T1D) in the nonobese diabetic mouse demonstrated that a crucial insulin epitope (B:9-23) is presented to diabetogenic CD4 T cells by IAg7 in a weakly bound register. The importance of antigenic peptides with low-affinity HLA binding in human autoimmune disease remains less clear. The objective of this study was to investigate T-cell responses to a low-affinity self-epitope in subjects with T1D. HLA-DQ8 tetramers loaded with a modified insulin peptide designed to improve binding the low-affinity register were used to visualize T-cell responses following in vitro stimulation. Positive responses were only detectable in T1D patients. Because the immunogenic register of B:9-23 presented by DQ8 has not been conclusively demonstrated, T-cell assays using substituted peptides and DQ8 constructs engineered to express and present B:9-23 in fixed binding registers were used to determine the immunogenic register of this peptide. Tetramer-positive T-cell clones isolated from T1D subjects that responded to stimulation by B:11-23 peptide and denatured insulin protein were conclusively shown to recognize B:11-23 bound to HLA-DQ8 in the low-affinity register 3. These T cells also responded to homologous peptides derived from microbial antigens, suggesting that their initial priming could occur via molecular mimicry. These results are in accord with prior observations from the nonobese diabetic mouse model, suggesting a mechanism shared by mouse and man through which T cells that recognize a weakly bound peptide can circumvent tolerance mechanisms and play a role in the initiation of autoimmune diseases, such as T1D."
862,"Massive isotopic effect in vacuum UV photodissociation of N2 and implications for meteorite data."
863,"Nitrogen isotopic distributions in the solar system extend across an enormous range, from -400 per thousand, in the solar wind and Jovian atmosphere, to about 5,000 per thousand in organic matter in carbonaceous chondrites. Distributions such as these require complex processing of nitrogen reservoirs and extraordinary isotope effects. While theoretical models invoke ion-neutral exchange reactions outside the protoplanetary disk and photochemical self-shielding on the disk surface to explain the variations, there are no experiments to substantiate these models. Experimental results of N2 photolysis at vacuum UV wavelengths in the presence of hydrogen are presented here, which show a wide range of enriched delta15N values from 648 per thousand to 13,412 per thousand in product NH3, depending upon photodissociation wavelength. The measured enrichment range in photodissociation of N2, plausibly explains the range of delta15N in extraterrestrial materials. This study suggests the importance of photochemical processing of the nitrogen reservoirs within the solar nebula."
864,"Memory trace and timing mechanism localized to cerebellar Purkinje cells."
865,"The standard view of the mechanisms underlying learning is that they involve strengthening or weakening synaptic connections. Learned response timing is thought to combine such plasticity with temporally patterned inputs to the neuron. We show here that a cerebellar Purkinje cell in a ferret can learn to respond to a specific input with a temporal pattern of activity consisting of temporally specific increases and decreases in firing over hundreds of milliseconds without a temporally patterned input. Training Purkinje cells with direct stimulation of immediate afferents, the parallel fibers, and pharmacological blocking of interneurons shows that the timing mechanism is intrinsic to the cell itself. Purkinje cells can learn to respond not only with increased or decreased firing but also with an adaptively timed activity pattern."
866,"Resting-state networks link invasive and noninvasive brain stimulation across diverse psychiatric and neurological diseases."
867,"Brain stimulation, a therapy increasingly used for neurological and psychiatric disease, traditionally is divided into invasive approaches, such as deep brain stimulation (DBS), and noninvasive approaches, such as transcranial magnetic stimulation. The relationship between these approaches is unknown, therapeutic mechanisms remain unclear, and the ideal stimulation site for a given technique is often ambiguous, limiting optimization of the stimulation and its application in further disorders. In this article, we identify diseases treated with both types of stimulation, list the stimulation sites thought to be most effective in each disease, and test the hypothesis that these sites are different nodes within the same brain network as defined by resting-state functional-connectivity MRI. Sites where DBS was effective were functionally connected to sites where noninvasive brain stimulation was effective across diseases including depression, Parkinson's disease, obsessive-compulsive disorder, essential tremor, addiction, pain, minimally conscious states, and Alzheimer's disease. A lack of functional connectivity identified sites where stimulation was ineffective, and the sign of the correlation related to whether excitatory or inhibitory noninvasive stimulation was found clinically effective. These results suggest that resting-state functional connectivity may be useful for translating therapy between stimulation modalities, optimizing treatment, and identifying new stimulation targets. More broadly, this work supports a network perspective toward understanding and treating neuropsychiatric disease, highlighting the therapeutic potential of targeted brain network modulation."
868,"Liver-directed gene therapy corrects cardiovascular lesions in feline mucopolysaccharidosis type I."
869,"Patients with mucopolysaccharidosis type I (MPS I), a genetic deficiency of the lysosomal enzyme alpha-l-iduronidase (IDUA), exhibit accumulation of glycosaminoglycans in tissues, with resulting diverse clinical manifestations including neurological, ocular, skeletal, and cardiac disease. MPS I is currently treated with hematopoietic stem cell transplantation or weekly enzyme infusions, but these therapies have significant drawbacks for patient safety and quality of life and do not effectively address some of the most critical clinical sequelae, such as life-threatening cardiac valve involvement. Using the naturally occurring feline model of MPS I, we tested liver-directed gene therapy as a means of achieving long-term systemic IDUA reconstitution. We treated four MPS I cats at 3-5 mo of age with an adeno-associated virus serotype 8 vector expressing feline IDUA from a liver-specific promoter. We observed sustained serum enzyme activity for 6 mo at approximately 30% of normal levels in one animal, and in excess of normal levels in three animals. Remarkably, treated animals not only demonstrated reductions in glycosaminoglycan storage in most tissues, but most also exhibited complete resolution of aortic valve lesions, an effect that has not been previously observed in this animal model or in MPS I patients treated with current therapies. These data point to clinically meaningful benefits of the robust enzyme expression achieved with hepatic gene transfer that extend beyond the economic and quality of life advantages over lifelong enzyme infusions."
870,"Delivery of an enzyme-IGFII fusion protein to the mouse brain is therapeutic for mucopolysaccharidosis type IIIB."
871,"Mucopolysaccharidosis type IIIB (MPS IIIB, Sanfilippo syndrome type B) is a lysosomal storage disease characterized by profound intellectual disability, dementia, and a lifespan of about two decades. The cause is mutation in the gene encoding alpha-N-acetylglucosaminidase (NAGLU), deficiency of NAGLU, and accumulation of heparan sulfate. Impediments to enzyme replacement therapy are the absence of mannose 6-phosphate on recombinant human NAGLU and the blood-brain barrier. To overcome the first impediment, a fusion protein of recombinant NAGLU and a fragment of insulin-like growth factor II (IGFII) was prepared for endocytosis by the mannose 6-phosphate/IGFII receptor. To bypass the blood-brain barrier, the fusion protein (""enzyme"") in artificial cerebrospinal fluid (""vehicle"") was administered intracerebroventricularly to the brain of adult MPS IIIB mice, four times over 2 wk. The brains were analyzed 1-28 d later and compared with brains of MPS IIIB mice that received vehicle alone or control (heterozygous) mice that received vehicle. There was marked uptake of the administered enzyme in many parts of the brain, where it persisted with a half-life of approximately 10 d. Heparan sulfate, and especially disease-specific heparan sulfate, was reduced to control level. A number of secondary accumulations in neurons [beta-hexosaminidase, LAMP1(lysosome-associated membrane protein 1), SCMAS (subunit c of mitochondrial ATP synthase), glypican 5, beta-amyloid, P-tau] were reduced almost to control level. CD68, a microglial protein, was reduced halfway. A large amount of enzyme also appeared in liver cells, where it reduced heparan sulfate and beta-hexosaminidase accumulation to control levels. These results suggest the feasibility of enzyme replacement therapy for MPS IIIB."
872,"Disruption of the immune-checkpoint VISTA gene imparts a proinflammatory phenotype with predisposition to the development of autoimmunity."
873,"V domain-containing Ig suppressor of T-cell activation (VISTA) is a negative checkpoint regulator that suppresses T cell-mediated immune responses. Previous studies using a VISTA-neutralizing monoclonal antibody show that VISTA blockade enhances T-cell activation. The current study describes a comprehensive characterization of mice in which the gene for VISTA has been deleted. Despite the apparent normal hematopoietic development in young mice, VISTA genetic deficiency leads to a gradual accumulation of spontaneously activated T cells, accompanied by the production of a spectrum of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. Enhanced T-cell responsiveness was also observed upon immunization with neoantigen. Despite the presence of multiorgan chronic inflammation, aged VISTA-deficient mice did not develop systemic or organ-specific autoimmune disease. Interbreeding of the VISTA-deficient mice with 2D2 T-cell receptor transgenic mice, which are predisposed to the development of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, drastically enhanced disease incidence and intensity. Disease development is correlated with the increase in the activation of encephalitogenic T cells in the periphery and enhanced infiltration into the CNS. Taken together, our data suggest that VISTA is a negative checkpoint regulator whose loss of function lowers the threshold for T-cell activation, allowing for an enhanced proinflammatory phenotype and an increase in the frequency and intensity of autoimmunity under susceptible conditions."
874,"Tissue injury and hypoxia promote malignant progression of prostate cancer by inducing CXCL13 expression in tumor myofibroblasts."
875,"Prostate cancer (PC) is a slowly progressing malignancy that often responds to androgen ablation or chemotherapy by becoming more aggressive, acquiring a neuroendocrine phenotype, and undergoing metastatic spread. We found that B lymphocytes recruited into regressing androgen-deprived tumors by C-X-C motif chemokine 13 (CXCL13), a chemokine whose expression correlates with clinical severity, play an important role in malignant progression and metastatic dissemination of PC. We now describe how androgen ablation induces CXCL13 expression. In both allografted and spontaneous mouse PC, CXCL13 is expressed by tumor-associated myofibroblasts that are activated on androgen ablation through a hypoxia-dependent mechanism. The same cells produce CXCL13 after chemotherapy. Myofibroblast activation and CXCL13 expression also occur in the normal prostate after androgen deprivation, and CXCL13 is expressed by myofibroblasts in human PC. Hypoxia activates hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1) and induces autocrine TGF-beta signaling that promotes myofibroblast activation and CXCL13 induction. In addition to TGF-beta receptor kinase inhibitors, myofibroblast activation and CXCL13 induction are blocked by phosphodiesterase 5 (PDE5) inhibitors. Both inhibitor types and myofibroblast immunodepletion block the emergence of castration-resistant PC in the transgenic adenocarcinoma of the mouse prostate (TRAMP) model of spontaneous metastatic PC with neuroendocrine differentiation."
876,"ICAM-1 as a molecular target for triple negative breast cancer."
877,"Triple negative breast cancers (TNBCs) have a high mortality rate owing to aggressive proliferation and metastasis and a lack of effective therapeutic options. Herein, we describe the overexpression of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) in human TNBC cell lines and tissues, and demonstrate that ICAM-1 is a potential molecular target and biomarker for TNBC therapy and diagnosis. We synthesized ICAM-1 antibody-conjugated iron oxide nanoparticles (ICAM-IONPs) as a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) probe to evaluate tumor targeting. Quantitative analysis of ICAM-1 surface expression predicted the targeting capability of ICAM-IONPs to TNBC cells. MRI of the TNBC xenograft tumor after systemic administration of ICAM-IONPs, coupled with iron quantification and histology, demonstrated a significant and sustained MRI contrast enhancement and probe accumulation in tumors with ICAM-1 overexpression relative to control. Identification of ICAM-1 as a TNBC target and biomarker may lead to the development of a new strategy and platform for addressing a critical gap in TNBC patient care."
878,"Quantitative and stoichiometric analysis of the microRNA content of exosomes."
879,"Exosomes have been proposed as vehicles for microRNA (miRNA) -based intercellular communication and a source of miRNA biomarkers in bodily fluids. Although exosome preparations contain miRNAs, a quantitative analysis of their abundance and stoichiometry is lacking. In the course of studying cancer-associated extracellular miRNAs in patient blood samples, we found that exosome fractions contained a small minority of the miRNA content of plasma. This low yield prompted us to perform a more quantitative assessment of the relationship between miRNAs and exosomes using a stoichiometric approach. We quantified both the number of exosomes and the number of miRNA molecules in replicate samples that were isolated from five diverse sources (i.e., plasma, seminal fluid, dendritic cells, mast cells, and ovarian cancer cells). Regardless of the source, on average, there was far less than one molecule of a given miRNA per exosome, even for the most abundant miRNAs in exosome preparations (mean +/- SD across six exosome sources: 0.00825 +/- 0.02 miRNA molecules/exosome). Thus, if miRNAs were distributed homogenously across the exosome population, on average, over 100 exosomes would need to be examined to observe one copy of a given abundant miRNA. This stoichiometry of miRNAs and exosomes suggests that most individual exosomes in standard preparations do not carry biologically significant numbers of miRNAs and are, therefore, individually unlikely to be functional as vehicles for miRNA-based communication. We propose revised models to reconcile the exosome-mediated, miRNA-based intercellular communication hypothesis with the observed stoichiometry of miRNAs associated with exosomes."
880,"Vasoprotective effect of PDGF-CC mediated by HMOX1 rescues retinal degeneration."
881,"Blood vessel degeneration is critically involved in nearly all types of degenerative diseases. Therefore strategies to enhance blood vessel protection and survival are highly needed. In this study, using different animal models and cultured cells, we show that PDGF-CC is a potent vascular protective and survival factor. PDGF-CC deficiency by genetic deletion exacerbated blood vessel regression/degeneration in various animal models. Importantly, treatment with PDGF-CC protein not only increased the survival of retinal blood vessels in a model of oxygen-induced blood vessel regression but also markedly rescued retinal and blood vessel degeneration in a disease model of retinitis pigmentosa. Mechanistically, we revealed that heme oxygenase-1 (HMOX1) activity is critically required for the vascular protective/survival effect of PDGF-CC, because blockade of HMOX1 completely abolished the protective effect of PDGF-CC in vitro and in vivo. We further found that both PDGF receptors, PDGFR-beta and PDGFR-alpha, are required for the vasoprotective effect of PDGF-CC. Thus our data show that PDGF-CC plays a pivotal role in maintaining blood vessel survival and may be of therapeutic value in treating various types of degenerative diseases."
882,"H-ferritin-nanocaged doxorubicin nanoparticles specifically target and kill tumors with a single-dose injection."
883,"An ideal nanocarrier for efficient drug delivery must be able to target specific cells and carry high doses of therapeutic drugs and should also exhibit optimized physicochemical properties and biocompatibility. However, it is a tremendous challenge to engineer all of the above characteristics into a single carrier particle. Here, we show that natural H-ferritin (HFn) nanocages can carry high doses of doxorubicin (Dox) for tumor-specific targeting and killing without any targeting ligand functionalization or property modulation. Dox-loaded HFn (HFn-Dox) specifically bound and subsequently internalized into tumor cells via interaction with overexpressed transferrin receptor 1 and released Dox in the lysosomes. In vivo in the mouse, HFn-Dox exhibited more than 10-fold higher intratumoral drug concentration than free Dox and significantly inhibited tumor growth after a single-dose injection. Importantly, HFn-Dox displayed an excellent safety profile that significantly reduced healthy organ drug exposure and improved the maximum tolerated dose by fourfold compared with free Dox. Moreover, because the HFn nanocarrier has well-defined morphology and does not need any ligand modification or property modulation it can be easily produced with high purity and yield, which are requirements for drugs used in clinical trials. Thus, these unique properties make the HFn nanocage an ideal vehicle for efficient anticancer drug delivery."
884,"ASCL1 is a lineage oncogene providing therapeutic targets for high-grade neuroendocrine lung cancers."
885,"Aggressive neuroendocrine lung cancers, including small cell lung cancer (SCLC) and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), represent an understudied tumor subset that accounts for approximately 40,000 new lung cancer cases per year in the United States. No targeted therapy exists for these tumors. We determined that achaete-scute homolog 1 (ASCL1), a transcription factor required for proper development of pulmonary neuroendocrine cells, is essential for the survival of a majority of lung cancers (both SCLC and NSCLC) with neuroendocrine features. By combining whole-genome microarray expression analysis performed on lung cancer cell lines with ChIP-Seq data designed to identify conserved transcriptional targets of ASCL1, we discovered an ASCL1 target 72-gene expression signature that (i) identifies neuroendocrine differentiation in NSCLC cell lines, (ii) is predictive of poor prognosis in resected NSCLC specimens from three datasets, and (iii) represents novel ""druggable"" targets. Among these druggable targets is B-cell CLL/lymphoma 2, which when pharmacologically inhibited stops ASCL1-dependent tumor growth in vitro and in vivo and represents a proof-of-principle ASCL1 downstream target gene. Analysis of downstream targets of ASCL1 represents an important advance in the development of targeted therapy for the neuroendocrine class of lung cancers, providing a significant step forward in the understanding and therapeutic targeting of the molecular vulnerabilities of neuroendocrine lung cancer."
886,"Antigen affinity and antigen dose exert distinct influences on CD4 T-cell differentiation."
887,"Cumulative T-cell receptor signal strength and ensuing T-cell responses are affected by both antigen affinity and antigen dose. Here we examined the distinct contributions of these parameters to CD4 T-cell differentiation during infection. We found that high antigen affinity positively correlates with T helper (Th)1 differentiation at both high and low doses of antigen. In contrast, follicular helper T cell (TFH) effectors are generated after priming with high, intermediate, and low affinity ligand. Unexpectedly, memory T cells generated after priming with very low affinity antigen remain impaired in their ability to generate secondary Th1 effectors, despite being recalled with high affinity antigen. These data challenge the view that only strongly stimulated CD4 T cells are capable of differentiating into the TFH and memory T-cell compartments and reveal that differential strength of stimulation during primary T-cell activation imprints unique and long lasting T-cell differentiation programs."
888,"Bevel direction of epidural needles reliably predicts direction of catheter placement and contrast spread in human cadavers: results of a pilot study."
889,"STUDY OBJECTIVE: To confirm the relationship between bevel orientation, catheter direction, and radiopaque contrast spread in the lumbar region. DESIGN: Pilot cadaver study. SETTING: Anatomy laboratory of a university hospital. MEASUREMENTS: Cadavers were randomized to two groups of 4 cadavers each. In Group 1, needle bevel direction at epidural entry was cephalad; in Group 2, it was caudad. After placement of each epidural catheter in L4-L5 interspace, 2 mL of radiopaque contrast was injected and a lumbar posterior-anterior radiograph was obtained. Catheter direction and direction of radiopaque contrast spread were collected. MAIN RESULTS: Due to the inability to access the epidural space secondary to surgical changes in the lumbar spine, one cadaver in the cephalad group was excluded. In 7 of 7 (100%) cadavers, the catheter tip direction according to the radiograph corresponded directly with bevel direction. CONCLUSIONS: A strong relationship exists between bevel orientation and catheter direction; however, catheter position does not reliably predict the direction in which the injected fluid spreads in all cadavers."
890,"Design of smart home sensor visualizations for older adults."
891,"BACKGROUND: Smart home sensor systems provide a valuable opportunity to continuously and unobtrusively monitor older adult wellness. However, the density of sensor data can be challenging to visualize, especially for an older adult consumer with distinct user needs. OBJECTIVE: We describe the design of sensor visualizations informed by interviews with older adults. The goal of the visualizations is to present sensor activity data to an older adult consumer audience that supports both longitudinal detection of trends and on-demand display of activity details for any chosen day. METHODS: The design process is grounded through participatory design with older adult interviews during a six-month pilot sensor study. Through a secondary analysis of interviews, we identified the visualization needs of older adults. We incorporated these needs with cognitive perceptual visualization guidelines and the emotional design principles of Norman to develop sensor visualizations. RESULTS: We present a design of sensor visualization that integrate both temporal and spatial components of information. The visualization supports longitudinal detection of trends while allowing the viewer to view activity within a specific date. CONCLUSIONS: Appropriately designed visualizations for older adults not only provide insight into health and wellness, but also are a valuable resource to promote engagement within care."
892,"Qualitative research on point-of-care testing strategies and programs for HIV."
893,"Point-of-care (POC) testing in communities, home settings and primary healthcare centers plays an important role in cutting delays in HIV diagnosis and in the uptake of voluntary testing and counseling. Qualitative research methods have important potential to overcome the current challenges in expanding HIV POC testing programs and strategies, by examining the diagnostic processes, complex inter-relationships and patterns involved in making POC diagnostics work in real-world settings. This article reviews existing qualitative studies on POC testing strategies and programs for HIV. Qualitative research on POC diagnostics around the uptake of POC tests, the actual diagnostic and testing processes involved, the influence of POC tests on clinical decision-making, communication of decisions and decisions exercised by patients are limited. Equally limited are studies that explore adaptation of POC programs to various socio-cultural contexts. More qualitative research is needed to inform test developers, funders and policymakers."
894,"Is residential treatment effective for opioid use disorders? A longitudinal comparison of treatment outcomes among opioid dependent, opioid misusing, and non-opioid using emerging adults with substance use disorder."
895,"BACKGROUND: Opioid misuse and dependence rates among emerging adults have increased substantially. While office-based opioid treatments (e.g., buprenorphine/naloxone) have shown overall efficacy, discontinuation rates among emerging adults are high. Abstinence-based residential treatment may serve as a viable alternative, but has seldom been investigated in this age group. METHODS: Emerging adults attending 12-step-oriented residential treatment (N=292; 18-24 years, 74% male, 95% White) were classified into opioid dependent (OD; 25%), opioid misuse (OM; 20%), and no opiate use (NO; 55%) groups. Paired t-tests and ANOVAs tested baseline differences and whether groups differed in their during-treatment response. Longitudinal multilevel models tested whether groups differed on substance use outcomes and treatment utilization during the year following the index treatment episode. RESULTS: Despite a more severe clinical profile at baseline among OD, all groups experienced similar during-treatment increases on therapeutic targets (e.g., abstinence self-efficacy), while OD showed a greater decline in psychiatric symptoms. During follow-up relative to OM, both NO and OD had significantly greater Percent Days Abstinent, and significantly less cannabis use. OD attended significantly more outpatient treatment sessions than OM or NO; 29% of OD was completely abstinent at 12-month follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: Findings here suggest that residential treatment may be helpful for emerging adults with opioid dependence. This benefit may be less prominent, though, among non-dependent opioid misusers. Randomized trials are needed to compare more directly the relative benefits of outpatient agonist-based treatment to abstinence-based, residential care in this vulnerable age-group, and to examine the feasibility of an integrated model."
896,"A Glycogene Mutation Map (GlyMAP) for Discovery of Diseases of Glycosylation."
897,"Glycosylation of proteins and lipids involves over 200 known glycosyltransferases, and deleterious defects in many of the genes encoding these enzymes cause disorders collectively classified as Congenital Disorders of Glycosylation (CDGs). Most known CDGs are caused by defects in glycogenes that effects glycosylation globally. Many glycosyltransferases are members of homologous isoenzyme families and deficiencies in individual isoenzymes may not affect glycosylation globally. In line with this there appears to be an underrepresentation of disease-causing glycogenes among these larger isoenzyme homologous families. However, Genome-Wide-Association Studies (GWAS) have identified such isoenzyme genes as candidates for different diseases, but validation is not straightforward without biomarkers. Large-scale whole exome sequencing (WES) provides access to mutations in e.g. glycosyltransferase genes in populations, which can be used to predict and/or analyze functional deleterious mutations. Here, we constructed a draft of a Functional Mutational Map of glycogenes, GlyMAP, from WES of a rather homogenous population of 2,000 Danes. We catalogued all missense mutations and used prediction algorithms, manual inspection, and in case of CAZy family GT27 experimental analysis of mutations to map deleterious mutations. GlyMAP provides a first global view of the genetic stability of the glycogenome and should serve as a tool for discovery of novel CDGs."
898,"Gastroesophageal and extraesophageal reflux symptoms: Similarities and differences."
899,"OBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESIS: The association between extraesophageal reflux (EER) and symptoms of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is inadequately understood. We used the Comprehensive Reflux Symptom Scale (CReSS) to evaluate EER and reflux-symptom prevalence in gastroenterology and otolaryngology outpatients and symptom awareness among UK gastroenterologists. STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional cohort survey. METHODS: Six hundred thirty-nine participants were surveyed: 103 controls, 359 patients undergoing esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD), and 177 otolaryngology clinic patients with throat symptoms. Participants completed the CReSS questionnaire. The study was undertaken in the Endoscopy Unit and the Department of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery, Newcastle upon Tyne Hospitals, Newcastle-upon-Tyne, United Kingdom. Registered members of the British Gastroenterology Society were asked to rate how frequently reflux patients might complain of each CReSS item. RESULTS: The median CReSS total in volunteers (4) was significantly lower (P < .002) than in ear, nose, and throat (ENT) patients (26) or EGD patients with (42) or without (32) esophageal inflammation. All items were scored as >/=1 by >15% of ENT patients and 28% of EGD patients. Three major, robust CReSS factors: esophageal, pharyngeal, and upper airway emerged. Of 259 gastroenterologists, >20% scored 8 of the 34 symptoms as never being reported by reflux patients. CONCLUSIONS: Endorsement of each EER CReSS item by 28% to 58% of patients with endoscopic evidence of GERD supports the Montreal consensus on an EER-GERD continuum. Gastroenterologists vary considerably in their appreciation of EER symptom relevance. The advantages of CReSS include standardized, comprehensive capture of patient experience; discriminant validity of ENT and GERD patients from volunteers; and discrete esophageal, pharyngeal, and upper airway subscales.

900,"Erectile dysfunction among male active component service members, U.S. Armed Forces, 2004-2013."
901,"Erectile dysfunction (ED) is considered a common medical disorder and it is the most common sexual complaint reported by men to healthcare providers. The epidemiology of this condition in active component U.S. service members has been unclear. This report describes the counts and rates of newly diagnosed ED in active component servicemen during 2004-2013. There were 100,248 incident cases of ED (rate: 8.4 per 1,000 person-years) during that period. ED cases classified as psychogenic comprised almost half of all ED cases. Annual incidence rates more than doubled between 2004 and 2013. Higher incidence rates were associated with advancing age; black, non-Hispanic ethnicity; marital status of separated, divorced, and widowed; higher level of education; and never having deployed. The editorial comments discuss comparisons with findings in the published literature, the limitations of this study, and possible additional analyses."
902,"A retrospective study of docetaxel or paclitaxel in patients with advanced or recurrent esophageal squamous cell carcinoma who previously received fluoropyrimidine- and platinum-based chemotherapy."
903,"INTRODUCTION: Fluoropyrimidine plus platinum (FP)-based chemotherapy has been widely used as a first-line regimen for advanced or recurrent esophageal cancer, and taxanes have shown efficacy after FP-based chemotherapy, but there is no standard regimen for second-line chemotherapy (SLC). We retrospectively investigated the clinical features of taxane therapy in SLC for esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). METHODS: The selection criteria were pathologically proven ESCC; advanced or recurrent disease previously treated with FP at our hospital; performance status (PS) 0-2; and adequate organ function. Docetaxel (DTX) was administered 3-weekly at 70 mg/m2. Paclitaxel (PTX) was administered at 100 mg/m2 weekly for 6 weeks, with 1 week's rest. RESULTS: The analysis covered 163 patients from August 2006 to June 2012. Median age was 64 years (range 37-83: DTX group 132 patients and PTX group 31). Progression-free survival and median overall survival (OS) were 2.3 and 6.1 months, respectively, with PTX and 2.3 and 5.3 months with DTX. Response rates were 20.7 % for PTX and 5.9 % for DTX. The rate of grades 3-4 neutropenia was higher with DTX (32.6 %) than with PTX (16.1 %). Grade 3 febrile neutropenia was seen in 6.1 % of DTX recipients but in no PTX group. According to multivariate analyses of OS, PS 2, number of metastatic sites >==2, and CRP >==1 mg/dL were independent predictors of poor prognosis. CONCLUSIONS: PTX and DTX were both effective in SLC for ESCC, but their toxicity profiles differed. In terms of febrile neutropenia, PTX seems more appropriate."
904,"Mycoplasma pneumoniae infections - Does treatment help?"
905,"Mycoplasma pneumoniae is a common cause of respiratory tract infections (RTI's), especially in children. While severe M. pneumoniae infections are generally treated with antibiotics, the diagnosis as well as treatment of these infections should be reconsidered in the light of recent clinical findings. First, M. pneumoniae was found to be carried in the upper respiratory tract of a relatively high percentage of healthy, asymptomatic children. Clearly, this complicates the diagnosis of a suspected M. pneumoniae RTI and, thus, the decision when to initiate treatment. A complication in the treatment of these infections is that data on the efficacy of antibiotic treatment of M. pneumoniae RTI's are sparse and derived exclusively from comparative studies. A recent Cochrane review concluded that there is insufficient evidence about the efficacy of antibiotics for M. pneumoniae lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI) in children. Due to side effects associated with the use of tetracyclines and quinolones in children, only macrolides can be used to treat M. pneumoniae infections in young patients. The general applicability of macrolides, however, is currently threatened by the worldwide increase in macrolide-resistant M. pneumoniae strains. Finally, limited evidence is available that corticosteroids might have an additional benefit in the treatment of M. pneumoniae infections. In this review, the current issues related to the diagnosis and treatment of M. pneumoniae infections will be discussed."
906,"Reversal time of postprandial changes of the thickness of abdominal muscles employing ultrasound measurements."
907,"OBJECTIVES: Low thickness of Transversus Abdominis, Internal Oblique and External Oblique muscles may play a role in development of low back pain. Ultrasonography is increasingly utilized to measure the thickness of these muscles. Prandial state has recently been proposed as a confounding factor in such measurements. We aimed to compare the reversal time of the postprandial thickness of these muscles with preprandial values. The measurement errors of ultrasonographic values were also assessed in both immediate preprandial and postprandial states. DESIGN: Interventional cross-sectional study. METHODS: The ultrasonographic thickness of lateral abdominal muscles was measured at rest and during abdominal drawing-in maneuver in 20 healthy participants before and after consumption of a specific meal. Postprandial ultrasound measurements continued every 15 min until their thickness reached 95% of their preprandial values. RESULTS: There was a statistically significant reduction in postprandial thickness of these muscles (all p-values <0.001 on both sides). The reversal times were 1.5, 1.3 and 1.2 h for Transversus Abdominis, Internal Oblique, and External Oblique muscles, respectively. Standard Error of Measurement and Smallest Detectable Change were in the range of 0.007-0.013 mm and 0.020-0.035 mm, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: To limit the effects of prandial state on the sonographic thickness of lateral abdominal muscles, we recommend measuring these values at least 1.5-2 h after food consumption. For the future studies, controlling the participants according to their prandial state is recommended."
908,"Hyperdense Cerebral Artery Computed Tomography Sign Is Associated with Stroke Severity rather than Stroke Subtype."
909,"BACKGROUND: The hyperdense cerebral artery sign (HCAS) on unenhanced computed tomography (CT) in acute ischemic stroke is a valuable clinical marker, but it remains unclear if HCAS reflects clot composition or stroke etiology. Therefore, variables independently associated with HCAS were identified from a large international data set of patients treated with intravenous thrombolysis. METHODS: All stroke patients undergoing intravenous thrombolysis from the Safe Implementation of Treatments in Stroke-EAST (SITS-EAST) database between February 2003 and December 2011 were analyzed. A general estimating equation model accounting for within-center clustering was used to identify factors independently associated with HCAS. RESULTS: Of all 8878 consecutive patients, 8375 patients (94%) with available information about HCAS were included in our analysis. CT revealed HCAS in 19% of patients. Median baseline National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score was 12, mean age was 67 +/- 12 years, and 3592 (43%) patients were females. HCAS was independently associated with baseline NIHSS (odds ratio [OR], 1.11; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.10-1.12), vessel occlusion (OR, 5.02; 95% CI, 3.31-7.63), early ischemic CT changes (OR, 1.63; 95% CI, 1.31-2.04), year (OR, 1.07; 95% CI, 1.02-1.12), and age (10-year increments; OR, .90; 95% CI, .84-.96). Cardioembolic stroke was not associated with HCAS independently of baseline NIHSS. In different centers, HCAS was reported in 0%-50% of patients. CONCLUSIONS: This study illustrates significant variation in detection of HCAS among stroke centers in routine clinical practice. Accounting for within-center data clustering, stroke subtype was not independently associated with HCAS; HCAS was associated with the severity of neurologic deficit."
910,"Bone Marrow Stromal Cells Combined with Oxiracetam Influences the Expression of B-cell Lymphoma 2 in Rats with Ischemic Stroke."
911,"This study aimed to investigate the combination effects of bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) and oxiracetam for ischemic stroke. Forty Sprague Dawley female rats (220 +/- 20 g) were subjected to a 2-hour ischemic middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO)-24 hours reperfusion model. The rats were randomly divided into 4 groups. Rats from BMSCs group, oxiracetam group, and BMSCs + oxiracetam group accepted injection of BMSCs (3 x 106 cells), oxiracetam (800 mg/kg), and BMSCs + oxiracetam, respectively. Rats from control group did not receive any interventions after ischemia reperfusion. The neurologic function was examined by modified neurological severity scores (mNSS). B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) expression and apoptosis were detected by immunohistochemistry and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL) staining. The mNSS was decreased in all treatment groups and that in BMSCs + oxiracetam group was lower than BMSCs group and oxiracetam group (P < .05). The expression of Bcl-2 was unregulated in all treatment groups (P < .05), and similarly, the expression of Bcl-2 in BMSCs + oxiracetam group was higher than BMSCs group and oxiracetam group (P < .05). Control group displayed more TUNEL-positive cells than the treatment groups, and BMSCs + oxiracetam group displayed less apoptotic cells than BMSCs group or oxiracetam group (P < .05). Transplantation of BMSCs can promote the recovery of neurologic function in MCAO rats, and the effect of BMSCs combined with oxiracetam was better than the either one. Upregulation of Bcl-2 resulting in a decrease of apoptosis may be one of the mechanisms of BMSCs treatment for cerebral ischemic stroke."
912,"Frequency of TERT promoter mutations in primary tumors of the liver."
913,"Transcriptional regulation of the TERT gene is a major cause of the cancer-specific increase in telomerase activity. Recently, frequent somatic mutations in the TERT promoter have been described in several tumor entities such as melanoma, glioblastoma, bladder cancer, and hepatocellular carcinoma. By generating a putative consensus binding site for ETS transcription factors within the TERT promoter, these mutations are predicted to increase promoter activity and TERT transcription. In order to improve the understanding of the role of TERT promoter mutation in liver tumorigenesis, the mutational status of the TERT promoter was analyzed in 78 hepatocellular carcinomas, 15 hepatocellular adenomas, and 52 intrahepatic cholangiocarciomas. The promoter region of TERT was screened for the two hotspot mutations using PCR and restriction fragment length analysis, utilizing the introduction of novel restriction sites by the somatic mutations. TERT promoter mutation was found in 37 of 78 hepatocellular carcinomas (47 %) and was restricted to the -124C>T mutation. Frequency of mutations was associated with grade of differentiation ranging from 39 % in well-differentiated tumors to 73 % in high-grade hepatocellular carcinomas. TERT promoter mutations were not found in 15 hepatocellular adenomas and 52 intrahepatic cholangiocarcinomas. These data show that TERT promoter mutation is the most frequent genetic alteration in hepatocellular carcinoma known at this time. The striking predominance of the -124C>T mutation compared with other tumor entities suggest a biological difference of the two hotspot mutations. Analysis of TERT promoter mutation might become a diagnostic tool distinguishing hepatocellular adenoma from well-differentiated hepatocellular carcinoma."
914,"Associations of Electrocardiographic P-wave Characteristics with Left Atrial Structure, Function and Diffuse Left Ventricular Fibrosis Defined by Cardiac Magnetic Resonance: the PRIMERI Study."
915,"BACKGROUND: Abnormal P-terminal force in V1 (PTFV1) is associated with an increased risk of heart failure, stroke, atrial fibrillation (AF) and death. OBJECTIVE: Our goal was to explore associations of left ventricular (LV) diffuse fibrosis with left atrium (LA) function and ECG measures of LA electrical activity. METHODS: AF-free patients (n=91, mean age 59.5, 61.5% men, 65.9% Caucasian) with structural heart disease (wide spatial QRS-T angle>/=105 degrees +/- Selvester QRS score>/=5 on ECG) but LV ejection fraction >35% underwent clinical evaluation, cardiac magnetic resonance and resting ECG. LA function indices were obtained by multimodality tissue tracking using 2 and 4-chamber long-axis images. T1 mapping and late gadolinium enhancement were used to assess diffuse LV fibrosis and presence of scar. P-prime in V1 amplitude (PPaV1) and duration (PPdV1), averaged P-duration, PR interval and P-axis were automatically measured using 12SL TM algorithm. PTFV1 was calculated as product of PPaV1 by PPdV1. RESULTS: In linear regression after adjustment for demographic, body mass index, LA volumemax index, presence of scar and LV mass index, each decile increase in LV interstitial fibrosis was associated with 0.76mV*ms increase in negative abnormal PTFV1 [(95%CI -1.42 to -0.09), P=0.025], 15.3ms prolongation in PPdV1 [(95%CI 6.9 to 23.8), P=0.001], and 5.4ms widening in averaged P-duration [(95%CI 0.9 to10.0), P=0.020]. LV fibrosis did not affect LA function. PPaV1 and PTFV1 were associated with an increase in LA volumes, decrease in LAEF and LA reservoir function. CONCLUSION: LV interstitial fibrosis is associated with abnormal PTFV1, prolonged PPdV1 and P-duration, but does not affect LA function."
916,"Mathematical modelling of patient flows to predict critical care capacity required following the merger of two district general hospitals into one."
917,"There is both medical and political drive to centralise secondary services in larger hospitals throughout the National Health Service. High-volume services in some areas of care have been shown to achieve better outcomes and efficiencies arising from economies of scale. We sought to produce a mathematical model using the historical critical care demand in two District General Hospitals to determine objectively the requisite critical care capacity in a newly built hospital. We also sought to determine how well the new single unit would be able to meet changes in demand. The intention is that the model should be generic and transferable for those looking to merge and rationalise services on to one site. One of the advantages of mathematical modelling is the ability to interrogate the model to investigate any number of different scenarios; some of these are presented."
918,"Pallidifloside D, a saponin glycoside constituent from smilax riparia, resist to hyperuricemia based on URAT1 and GLUT9 in hyperuricemic mice."
919,"ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: The roots and rhizomes of Smilax riparia (SR), called ""Niu-Wei-Cai"" in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), are believed to be effective in treating hyperuricemia and gout symptoms. This study was designed to isolate a saponin glycoside named pallidifloside D from the total saponins of S. riparia and to examine its effect in reducing serum uric acid levels in a hyperuricemic mouse model induced by potassium oxonate. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We examined the effects of pallidifloside D treated with 5, 10 and 20mg/kg on serum uric acid levels (SUA), Serum creatinine (SCr) and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) levels in a hyperuricemic mouse. Colorimetric method was used to evaluate the effects of pallidifloside D on the XOD activities, and Western Blotting analysis were carried out to observe protein levels of mURAT1, mGLUT9 and mOTA1 in hyperuricemic mice after treatment with pallidifloside D. RESULTS: The levels of serum uric acid levels (SUA) were suppressed significantly with dose-dependence by pallidifloside D treated with 5, 10 and 20mg/kg (p<0.05, p<0.01 and p<0.01 respectively). Pallidifloside D could down-regulate the expression levels of renal mURAT1 protein in hyperuricemic mice in a dose-dependent manner (p<0.05, p<0.01, and p<0.001 respectively), and the protein levels of mGLUT9 could be down-regulated with dose-dependence (p<0.05 and p<0.01 respectively) by pallidifloside D at the dose of 10 and 20mg/kg. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that pallidifloside D possesses potent uricosuric effect in hyperuricemic mice through decreasing renal mURAT1 and GLUT9, which contribute to the enhancement of uric acid excretion and attenuate hyperuricemia-induced renal dysfunction."
920,"Shensong Yangxin capsule prevents diabetic myocardial fibrosis by inhibiting TGF-beta1/Smad signaling."
921,"ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Shensong Yangxin Capsule (SSYX), a traditional Chinese herbal medicine, has long been used clinically to treat arrhythmias in China. However, the effect of SSYX on interstitial fibrosis in diabetic cardiomyopathy is unknown. The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of SSYX on myocardial fibrosis in diabetic rats. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The antifibrotic effect of SSYX was investigated in streptozocin (STZ)-induced diabetic rats with high fat-diet (HFD). Fasting blood glucose, heart weight/body weight ratio, total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TG), high density lipoprotein (HDL) and low density lipoprotein (LDL) were measured. Echocardiography and histology examination were carried out to evaluate heart function. Expression of Smad7, TGF-beta1, collagen I (col-1), collagen III (col-3), MMP-2 and MMP-9mRNA in heart tissues were measured by real time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). TGF-beta1, Smad2/3, p-Smad2/3 and Smad7 protein levels were measured by western blot analysis. Proliferation of cardiac fibroblast was detected via immunofluorescence. RESULTS: SSYX markedly decreased heart weight/body weight ratio and improved the impaired cardiac function of T2DM rats. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM), haematoxylin and eosin (HE) and Masson staining results showed that SSYX attenuated cardiac fibrosis and collagen deposition in T2DM rats. Moreover, mRNA levels of TGF-beta1, col-1, col-3, MMP-2 and MMP-9 were downregulated, whereas Smad7 expression was upregulated after treatment with SSYX in rats with cardiac fibrosis. Furthermore, SSYX decreased protein levels of TGF-beta1 and p-Smad2/3, and increased Smad7 expression. CONCLUSION: TGF-beta1/Smad signaling is involved in the cardiac fibrosis in diabetic cardiomyopathy and SSYX inhibits fibrosis and improves cardiac function via suppressing this pathway. Therefore, SSYX might be considered an alternative therapeutic remedy for diabetic cardiomyopathy."
922,"Inhibitory effect of Ecliptae herba extract and its component wedelolactone on pre-osteoclastic proliferation and differentiation."
923,"ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Ecliptae herba, also known as ""Mo-Han-Lian"", has long been used in China to nourish Kidney and thereafter strengthen bones. Accumulating evidence indicates that extracts of Ecliptae herba have antiosteoporotic effect. However, the effective compounds and cellular mode of action are still unclear. AIM OF THE STUDY: To investigate the effect of ethyl acetate extract of Ecliptae herba (EAE) and its component wedelolactone on proliferation and differentiation of preosteoclastic RAW264.7 cells as well as proliferation of bone marrow stromal cells (BMSC). MATERIALS AND METHODS: RAW264.7 and BMSC were examined for proliferation by 3-(4,5-dimethyl-2-thiazolyl)-2,5-diphenyl-2-H-tetrazolium bromide (MTT) method. Tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) activity of RAW264.7 was measured by using p-nitrophenyl sodium phosphate (pNPP) asasy after the cells were treated with 30ng/ml receptor activator for nuclear factor-kappa B ligand (RANKL) plus various concentrations of EAE, wedelolactone or alendronate. The formation of multinucleated TRAP-positive RAW264.7 cells was observed by using a TRAP-staining kit. RESULTS: Treatment of RAW264.7 cells with EAE at high doses (20microg/ml and 40microg/ml) or wedelolactone at 10microg/ml resulted in a decrease in proliferation of RAW264.7 cells. Low doses of EAE (5, 10microg/ml) and wedelolactone (2.5microg/ml) inhibited RANKL-induced TRAP activity by 20.3%, 37.9%, and 48.3%, respectively. The inhibitory effect of wedelolactone is more potent than that of alendronate, an anti-resorptive drug. Morphological changes revealed that 5microg/ml EAE and 2.5microg/ml wedelolactone reduced the number of multinucleated osteoclast-like cells. At the high doses, EAE (20microg/ml) and wedelolactone (10microg/ml) inhibited the growth of BMSC. CONCLUSIONS: EAE and its component wedelolactone inhibited osteoclast RAW264.7 proliferation and differentiation at the low doses, but at the high doses, showed cytotoxic effect on BMSC. These results indicated that EAE and wedelolatone might be potential alternative therapy for osteoporosis."
924,"In vitro study of the impact of mechanical tension on the dermal fibroblast phenotype in the context of skin wound healing."
925,"Skin wound healing is finely regulated by both matrix synthesis and degradation which are governed by dermal fibroblast activity. Actually, fibroblasts synthesize numerous extracellular matrix proteins (i.e., collagens), remodeling enzymes and their inhibitors. Moreover, they differentiate into myofibroblasts and are able to develop endogenous forces at the wound site. Such forces are crucial during skin wound healing and have been widely investigated. However, few studies have focused on the effect of exogenous mechanical tension on the dermal fibroblast phenotype, which is the objective of the present paper. To this end, an exogenous, defined, cyclic and uniaxial mechanical strain was applied to fibroblasts cultured as scratch-wounded monolayers. Results showed that fibroblasts response was characterized by both an increase in procollagen type-I and TIMP-1 synthesis, and a decrease in MMP-1 synthesis. The monitoring of scratch-wounded monolayers did not show any decrease in kinetics of the filling up when mechanical tension was applied. Additional results obtained with proliferating fibroblasts and confluent monolayer indicated that mechanical tension-induced response of fibroblasts depends on their culture conditions. In conclusion, mechanical tension leads to the differentiation of dermal fibroblasts and may increase their wound-healing capacities. So, the exogenous uniaxial and cyclic mechanical tension reported in the present study may be considered in order to improve skin wound healing."
926,"BAX and CDKN1A polymorphisms correlated with clinical outcomes of gastric cancer patients treated with postoperative chemotherapy."
927,"This study aims to examine the correlation between two single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of apoptosis-related genes and clinical outcomes in gastric cancer. A total of 221 patients with stage T2 and T3 gastric cancer treated with postoperative chemotherapy between 2003 and 2008 were retrospectively collected in this study to explore the association of rs4645878 located in BAX gene and rs1801270 located in CDKN1A gene with survival, recurrence, and toxicity to chemotherapy. Additionally, immunohistochemistry was used to detect the BAX expression in gastric cancer tissues. Patients carrying at least one variant genotype in BAX SNP (rs4645878) showed a significantly increased recurrence risk [hazard ratio (HR) 2.63; 95 % confidence internal (95 % CI) 1.71-4.03] and poor survival (HR 2.89; 95 % CI 1.88-4.44). Moreover, the recurrence and survival rate in patients with GA genotype was 72.7 and 24.7 %, respectively, compared with total recurrence rate of 54.8 %, P = 0.006, and compared with total survival rate of 46.6 %, P = 0.001. In addition, the GA genotype was related to lower BAX expression in gastric cancer tissues. The CDKN1A (rs1801270) mutant genotype was associated with a significantly decreased risk of hematologic toxicity [odds ratio (OR) 0.28; 95 % CI 0.12-0.63]. SNPs located in BAX and CDKN1A genes are closely associated with clinical outcomes in patients with gastric cancer."
928,"The prognostic significance of Smad3, Smad4, Smad3 phosphoisoform expression in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma."
929,"Smad3 functions as an integrator of diverse signaling, including transforming growth factor beta signaling and the function of Smad3 is complexly regulated by differential phosphorylation at various sites of Smad3. Despite the importance of Smad3 and its various phosphoisoforms, their prognostic significance has rarely been studied. In this study, we demonstrated the prognostic significance of Smad3, its phosphoisoforms, and Smad4 expression by immunohistochemistry in 126 esophageal squamous cell carcinomas. The phosphoisoforms of Smad3 studied in this article included phosphorylation at C-terminal (pSmad3C)(Ser(423/425)) and phosphorylation at the linker region (pSmad3L)(Ser(213)). High expression of Smad3 was associated with shorter overall survival. Co-existence of high expression of pSmad3L(S213) and low expression of pSmad3C(S423/425) were associated with advanced N stage and an independent prognostic factor for overall [hazard ratio (HR) 2.03, 95 % confidence interval (CI) (1.10-3.75), p = 0.023] and disease-free survival [HR 2.41, 95 % CI (1.32-4.39), p = 0.004]. In conclusion, co-existence of high pSmad3L(Ser(213)) expression and low pSmad3C(Ser(423/425)) expression can be considered as immunohistochemical biomarkers for predicting prognosis as well as future therapeutic targets. In addition, our results of combinatory effect of differential phosphorylation of Smad3 on prognosis suggest the mode of action of Smad3 might be logically determined by its phosphorylation pattern."
930,"Electroencephalography (EEG) for neurological prognostication after cardiac arrest and targeted temperature management; rationale and study design."
931,"BACKGROUND: Electroencephalography (EEG) is widely used to assess neurological prognosis in patients who are comatose after cardiac arrest, but its value is limited by varying definitions of pathological patterns and by inter-rater variability. The American Clinical Neurophysiology Society (ACNS) has recently proposed a standardized EEG-terminology for critical care to address these limitations. METHODS/DESIGN: In the TTM-trial, 399 post cardiac arrest patients who remained comatose after rewarming underwent a routine EEG. The presence of clinical seizures, use of sedatives and antiepileptic drugs during the EEG-registration were prospectively documented. DISCUSSION: A well-defined terminology for interpreting post cardiac arrest EEGs is critical for the use of EEG as a prognostic tool. TRIAL REGISTRATION: The TTM-trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT01020916)."
932,"Occurrence of pulmonary rheumatoid nodules following biological therapies."
933,"In rheumatoid arthritis (RA), disease activity is generally determined by the joint involvement, but the treatment outcome is often influenced by extra-articular manifestations. Authors present a 74-year-old female patient's case history, who was treated with seropositive RA. Marked disease activity was observed even following combined traditional disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD) treatment (disease activity score in 28 joints (DAS28) = 6.6). Therefore, the patient received TNF-alpha antagonist therapy. Golimumab was administered subcutaneous (SC) once monthly which resulted in significant improvement in both clinical and laboratory signs (DAS28 = 3:43). However, the follow-up chest x-ray indicated multiple intrapulmonary foci and enlarged lymph nodes. Biopsies and histology excluded malignancy; rheumatoid nodules were confirmed. Anti-TNF therapy was discontinued and tocilizumab treatment was initiated. The IL-6 receptor inhibitor suppressed arthritic activity, and 2 months later, the follow-up chest x-ray showed a regression of chest nodules. Our cases, as well as reports from other centers, suggest that TNF blockade may induce rheumatoid nodulosis and the use of alternative biologics may be feasible as further treatment of RA."
934,"M-type Phospholipase A2 Receptor Autoantibodies and Renal Function in Patients with Primary Membranous Nephropathy."
935,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Loss of renal function in patients with primary membranous nephropathy cannot be reliably predicted by laboratory or clinical markers at the time of diagnosis. M-type phospholipase A2 receptor autoantibodies have been shown to be associated with changes in proteinuria. Their eventual effect on renal function, however, is unclear. DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, & MEASUREMENTS: In this prospective, open, multicenter study, the potential role of M-type phospholipase A2 receptor autoantibodies levels on the increase of serum creatinine in 118 consecutive patients with membranous nephropathy and positivity for serum M-type phospholipase A2 receptor autoantibodies was analyzed. Patients were included in the study between April of 2010 and December of 2012 and observed until December of 2013. The clinical end point was defined as an increase of serum creatinine by >/=25% and serum creatinine reaching >/=1.3 mg/dl. RESULTS: Patients were divided into tertiles according to their M-type phospholipase A2 receptor autoantibody levels at the time of inclusion in the study: tertile 1 levels=20-86 units/ml (low), tertile 2 levels=87-201 units/ml (medium), and tertile 3 levels >/=202 units/ml (high). The median follow-up time of all patients in the study was 27 months (interquartile range=18-33 months). The clinical end point was reached in 69% of patients with high M-type phospholipase A2 receptor autoantibodies levels (tertile 3) but only 25% of patients with low M-type phospholipase A2 receptor autoantibodies levels. The average time to reach the study end point was 17.7 months in patients with high M-type phospholipase A2 receptor autoantibodies levels and 30.9 months in patients with low M-type phospholipase A2 receptor autoantibodies levels. A multivariate Cox regression analysis showed that high M-type phospholipase A2 receptor autoantibodies levels-in addition to men and older age-are an independent predictor for progressive loss of renal function. CONCLUSIONS: High M-type phospholipase A2 receptor autoantibodies levels were associated with more rapid loss of renal function in this cohort of patients with primary membranous nephropathy and therefore, could be helpful for treatment decisions."
936,"Quality of Survey Reporting in Nephrology Journals: A Methodologic Review."
937,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Survey research is an important research method used to determine individuals' attitudes, knowledge, and behaviors; however, as with other research methods, inadequate reporting threatens the validity of results. This study aimed to describe the quality of reporting of surveys published between 2001 and 2011 in the field of nephrology. DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, & MEASUREMENTS: The top nephrology journals were systematically reviewed (2001-2011: American Journal of Kidney Diseases, Nephrology Dialysis Transplantation, and Kidney International; 2006-2011: Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology) for studies whose primary objective was to collect and report survey results. Included were nephrology journals with a heavy focus on clinical research and high impact factors. All titles and abstracts were screened in duplicate. Surveys were excluded if they were part of a multimethod study, evaluated only psychometric characteristics, or used semi-structured interviews. Information was collected on survey and respondent characteristics, questionnaire development (e.g., pilot testing), psychometric characteristics (e.g., validity and reliability), survey methods used to optimize response rate (e.g., system of multiple contacts), and response rate. RESULTS: After a screening of 19,970 citations, 216 full-text articles were reviewed and 102 surveys were included. Approximately 85% of studies reported a response rate. Almost half of studies (46%) discussed how they developed their questionnaire and only a quarter of studies (28%) mentioned the validity or reliability of the questionnaire. The only characteristic that improved over the years was the proportion of articles reporting missing data (2001-2004: 46.4%; 2005-2008: 61.9%; and 2009-2011: 84.8%; respectively) (P<0.01). CONCLUSIONS: The quality of survey reporting in nephrology journals remains suboptimal. In particular, reporting of the validity and reliability of the questionnaire must be improved. Guidelines to improve survey reporting and increase transparency are clearly needed."
938,"Confidence intervals for a difference between lognormal means in cluster randomization trials."
939,"Cluster randomization trials, in which intact social units are randomized to different interventions, have become popular in the last 25 years. Outcomes from these trials in many cases are positively skewed, following approximately lognormal distributions. When inference is focused on the difference between treatment arm arithmetic means, existent confidence interval procedures either make restricting assumptions or are complex to implement. We approach this problem by assuming log-transformed outcomes from each treatment arm follow a one-way random effects model. The treatment arm means are functions of multiple parameters for which separate confidence intervals are readily available, suggesting that the method of variance estimates recovery may be applied to obtain closed-form confidence intervals. A simulation study showed that this simple approach performs well in small sample sizes in terms of empirical coverage, relatively balanced tail errors, and interval widths as compared to existing methods. The methods are illustrated using data arising from a cluster randomization trial investigating a critical pathway for the treatment of community acquired pneumonia."
940,"Brinzolamide plus brimonidine for the treatment of glaucoma: an update."
941,"Introduction: Glaucoma is a common sight-threatening condition that is primarily treated by lowering intraocular pressure (IOP). Today the mainstay of treatment is topical ocular hypotensive medications; many patients require more than one agent to achieve target IOP. For such patients, fixed combination formulations have several advantages including simplicity of treatment regimen, adherence to the treatment regimen, efficacy, improved ocular surface comfort and reduced cost. All currently available fixed combinations contain a beta-blocker, which is contraindicated in some patients. Hence there is a clinical need for fixed-combination preparations without a beta-blocker. This paper reviews the current literature on a new fixed-combination drug containing brinzolamide 1% and brimonidine 0.2% (BBFC). Areas covered: A PubMed, Embase and ClinicalTrials.gov registry search was performed to identify all relevant studies. Four published clinical papers pertaining to three randomized controlled trials were identified for review. All studies demonstrated a significant reduction (p < 0.01) in mean IOP in patients administered with BBFC compared with its individual components, brinzolamide 1% or brimonidine 0.2%. Adverse effects from BBFC were no different from each of the individual components, the most common being blurred vision, eye irritation and dysgeusia (abnormal taste sensation). Although BBFC use was associated with more adverse effects compared with the individual components used as monotherapy (p < 0.001), the cumulative adverse effect profile from BBFC did not appear greater than one would expect from the simultaneous use of the two components. Expert opinion: BBFC is a potential alternative to other fixed-combination medications and is especially useful when topical beta-blockers are contraindicated. Longer-term experience will determine if additional adverse effects occur or if efficacy is maintained over longer periods."
942,"The potential value of comprehensive geriatric assessment in evaluating older women with primary operable breast cancer undergoing surgery or non-operative treatment - A pilot study."
943,"OBJECTIVES: Breast cancer in older women raises a number of discrete issues, including how healthcare professionals can best decide which patients are candidates for surgery. A pilot study involving women aged >/=70years newly diagnosed with early operable primary breast cancer was conducted aiming to explore the potential value of comprehensive geriatric assessment (CGA). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Decision of primary treatment followed consultation with the clinical team and was not guided by any aspect of this study. CGA, using a validated cancer-specific tool, was conducted within 6weeks and 6months after diagnosis, complemented by formal measures of quality of life (QOL) (using EORTC QLQ-C30 and QLQ-BR23) and semi-structured interviews. A total of 47 female patients with a new diagnosis of clinically early (stage 1 or 2; cT0-2N0-1M0) operable primary breast cancer proven histologically, were recruited. RESULTS: CGA determined that increasing age (>/=80years) (p=0.001), greater (>/=4) comorbidity (p=0.022), greater number (>/=4) of daily medications (p=0.002), and slower (>/=19s) timed up and go (TUG) (p=0.016) score were significantly related to non-surgical treatment at 6weeks after diagnosis. Baseline QOL scores were generally good and they remained stable at 6months follow-up. As opposed to CGA, there was no correlation between QOL scores and the treatment modality identified. Semi-structured interviews identified themes consistent with findings from QOL assessment. CONCLUSION: The pilot study confirmed the feasibility of conducting CGA in a research setting which appeared to have value in assessing this patient population. More data will be required to definitively identify the components for geriatric assessment in this setting. The study has now extended into two more centres."
944,"Pain Management for Children during Bone Marrow and Stem Cell Transplantation."
945,"Pain management for children during bone marrow and stem cell transplantation is a significant clinical challenge for the health care team. Pain management strategies vary by institution. This paper reports on the use of a pediatric pain management service and patient- and caregiver-controlled analgesia for children undergoing transplant. This 2-year retrospective chart review examined the pain management practices and outcomes of children undergoing bone marrow and stem cell transplants in a large urban teaching hospital during 2008 and 2009. We concluded that patient- and caregiver-controlled analgesia is a well-tolerated modality for pain control during hospitalization for transplantation at this institution."
946,"Dominant Cystoid Macular Dystrophy."
947,"OBJECTIVE: To describe the clinical characteristics and long-term follow-up in patients with autosomal dominant cystoid macular dystrophy (DCMD). DESIGN: Retrospective case series. PARTICIPANTS: Ninety-seven patients with DCMD. METHODS: Extensive ophthalmic examination, including visual acuity (VA), fundus photography, fluorescein angiography (FA), fundus autofluorescence (FAF) imaging, optical coherence tomography (OCT), color vision testing, dark adaptation testing, full-field electroretinography (ERG), and electro-oculography (EOG). Blood samples were obtained for DNA extraction and subsequent haplotype analysis. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Age at onset, VA, fundus appearance, and characteristics on FA, FAF, OCT, ERG, and EOG. RESULTS: Cystoid fluid collections (CFCs) were the first retinal abnormalities detectable in DCMD, developing during childhood. At long-term follow-up, the CFCs decreased in size and number, and eventually disappeared with concurrent development of progressive chorioretinal atrophy and hyperpigmented deposits in the posterior pole. Dominant cystoid macular dystrophy could be classified into 3 stages, based on characteristics on ophthalmoscopy, FAF, FA, and OCT, as well as on results of electrophysiologic analysis. The staging system correlated with age and VA. In stage 1 DCMD (20 patients; 22%), patients generally were younger than 20 years and had CFCs with fine folding of the internal limiting membrane and mild pigment changes. In stage 2 DCMD (48 patients; 52%), the CFCs tended to decrease in size, and moderate macular chorioretinal atrophy developed. Patients with stage 3 DCMD (24 patients; 26%) generally were older than 50 years and showed profound chorioretinal atrophy, as well as coarse hyperpigmented deposits in the posterior pole. Most patients were (highly) hyperopic (72 patients; 92%). All DCMD patients shared the disease haplotype at the DCMD locus at 7p15.3. CONCLUSIONS: Dominant cystoid macular dystrophy is a progressive retinal dystrophy, characterized primarily by early-onset cystoid fluid collections in the neuroretina, which distinguishes this disorder from other retinal dystrophies. The phenotypic range of DCMD can be classified into 3 stages. The genetic locus for this retinal dystrophy has been mapped to 7p15.3, but the involved gene is currently unknown."
948,"Renal thrombotic microangiopathy and podocytopathy associated with the use of carfilzomib in a patient with multiple myeloma."
949,"BACKGROUND: Proteasome inhibitors are a relatively new class of chemotherapeutic agents. Bortezomib is the first agent of this class and is currently being used for the treatment of multiple myeloma. However, recent reports have linked exposure to bortezomib with the development of thrombotic microangiopathy. A new agent in this class, carfilzomib, has been recently introduced as alternative therapy for relapsing and refractory multiple myeloma. We report a case of renal thrombotic microangiopathy associated with the use of carfilzomib in a patient with refractory multiple myeloma. CASE PRESENTATION: A 62 year-old Caucasian man with hypertension and a 4-year history of multiple myeloma, had been previously treated with lenalidomide, bortezomib and two autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplants. After the second hematopoietic stem cell transplant, he developed acute kidney injury secondary to septic shock and required dialysis for 4 weeks. Subsequently, his serum creatinine stabilized at 2.1 mg/dL (185.64 mumol/L). Seventeen months after the second hematopoietic stem cell transplant, he was initiated on carfilzomib for relapse of multiple myeloma. Six weeks later, he developed abrupt worsening of lower extremity edema and hypertension, and new onset proteinuria. His kidney function remained stable. Kidney biopsy findings were consistent with thrombotic microangiopathy. Eight weeks after discontinuation of carfilzomib, proteinuria and hypertension improved. Due to progression of multiple myeloma, he died a few months later. CONCLUSION: In view of the previously reported association of bortezomib with thrombotic microangiopathy, the temporal association of the clinical picture with the initiation of carfilzomib, and the partial resolution of symptoms after discontinuation of the drug, we conclude that carfilzomib may have precipitated a case of clinically evident renal thrombotic microangiopathy in our patient."
950,"Genomic High-Resolution Profiling of Single CKpos/CD45neg Flow-Sorting Purified Circulating Tumor Cells from Patients with Metastatic Breast Cancer."
951,"BACKGROUND: Circulating tumor cells (CTCs) are promising surrogate markers for systemic disease, and their molecular characterization might be relevant to guide more individualized cancer therapies. To enable fast and efficient purification of individual CTCs, we developed a work flow from CellSearch(TM) cartridges enabling high-resolution genomic profiling on the single-cell level. METHODS: Single CTCs were sorted from 40 CellSearch samples from patients with metastatic breast cancer using a MoFlo XDP cell sorter. Genomes of sorted single cells were amplified using an adapter-linker PCR. Amplification products were analyzed by array-based comparative genomic hybridization, a gene-specific quantitative PCR (qPCR) assay for cyclin D1 (CCND1) locus amplification, and genomic sequencing to screen for mutations in exons 1, 9, and 20 of the phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase, catalytic subunit alpha (PIK3CA) gene and exons 5, 7, and 8 of the tumor protein p53 (TP53) gene. RESULTS: One common flow-sorting protocol was appropriate for 90% of the analyzed CellSearch cartridges, and the detected CTC numbers correlated positively with those originally detected with the CellSearch system (R(2) = 0.9257). Whole genome amplification was successful in 72.9% of the sorted single CTCs. Over 95% of the cells displayed chromosomal aberrations typical for metastatic breast cancers, and amplifications at the CCND1 locus were validated by qPCR. Aberrant CTCs from 2 patients harbored mutations in exon 20 of the PIK3CA gene. CONCLUSIONS: This work flow enabled effective CTC isolation and provided insights into genomic alterations of CTCs in metastatic breast cancer. This approach might facilitate further molecular characterization of rare CTCs to increase understanding of their biology and as a basis for their molecular screening in the clinical setting."
952,"Comparison of Chinese inpatients with different types of medical insurance before and after the 2009 healthcare reform."
953,"BACKGROUND: Since 1994, China has established three major basic medical insurance (MI) schemes that aim to provide greater financial protection to members. The 2009 Chinese medical reform emphasized the enhancement of basic medical insurance. This study aims to investigate changes in hospital services costs for inpatients with different types of MI before and after the new Chinese medical reform. METHODS: A total of 532,120 inpatient medical records, completed by 11 different hospitals nationwide in 2008 and 2011, were collected from the Ministry of Health retrospectively. Median and mean values were calculated to describe costs and average length of stay, respectively. A chi-square test was used to compare the distribution of patient visits. Wilcoxon rank-sum tests were conducted to compare costs. RESULTS: The number of patients hospitalized increased. The average cost per stay in the three basic MI schemes increased, while out-of-pocket (OOP) spending decreased (P < 0.0001). The average cost per day showed similar trends. The purchase of Western medication accounted for the largest proportion of costs in all MI schemes in both years; however, these ratios decreased from 2008 to 2011, while those for other social insurance and OOP patients almost doubled. The average length of stay remained unchanged, and the average lengths of stay in the MI schemes differed before and after the healthcare reform. CONCLUSIONS: Healthcare reform with multipartite policies may make interactional impacts on hospitalization services for patients enrolled in MI schemes.Graphical Abstract<!-- [INSERT GRAPHICAL ABSTRACT TEXT HERE] -->"
954,"Cross-sectional imaging of metal-on-metal hip arthroplasties."
955,"Background and purpose - Metal artifact reduction sequence (MARS) MRI is widely advocated for surveillance of metal-on-metal hip arthroplasties (MOM-HAs). However, its use is limited by susceptibility artifact at the prosthesis-bone interface, local availability, patient compliance, and cost (Hayter et al. 2011a). We wanted to determine whether CT is a suitable substitute for MARS MRI in evaluation of the painful MOM-HA. Patients and methods - 50 MOM-HA patients (30 female) with unexplained painful prostheses underwent MARS MRI and CT imaging. 2 observers who were blind regarding the clinical data objectively reported the following outcomes: soft tissue lesions (pseudotumors), muscle atrophy, and acetabular and femoral osteolysis. Diagnostic test characteristics were calculated. Results - Pseudotumor was diagnosed in 25 of 50 hips by MARS MRI and in 11 of 50 by CT. Pseudotumors were classified as type 1 (n = 2), type 2A (n = 17), type 2B (n = 4), and type 3 (n = 2) by MARS MRI. CT did not permit pseudotumor classification. The sensitivity of CT for diagnosis of pseudotumor was 44% (95% CI: 25-65). CT had ""slight"" agreement with MARS MRI for quantification of muscle atrophy (kappa = 0.23, CI: 0.16-0.29; p < 0.01). Osteolysis was identified in 15 of 50 patients by CT. 4 of these lesions were identified by MARS MRI. Interpretation - CT was found to be superior to MRI for detection of osteolysis adjacent to MOM-HA, and should be incorporated into diagnostic algorithms. CT was unable to classify and failed to detect many pseudotumors, and it was unreliable for assessment of muscle atrophy. Where MARS MRI is contraindicated or unavailable, CT would be an unsuitable substitute and other modalities such as ultrasound should be considered."
956,"The tyrphostin, NT157, suppresses insulin receptor substrates and augments therapeutic response of prostate cancer."
957,"Insulin-like growth factor (IGF) signaling is associated with castrate-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) progression. Insulin receptor substrates 1 and 2 (IRS1/2) mediate mitogenic and anti-apoptotic signaling from IGF-1 receptor (IGF-1R), insulin receptor and other oncoproteins. This study demonstrates that IRS1/2 expression is increased in PCa and, persists in CRPC. Furthermore, this study assesses the anti-cancer activity of NT157, a small-molecule tyrphostin targeting IRS proteins, using androgen-responsive (LNCaP) and -independent (PC3) prostate cancer cells in vitro and in vivo. NT157 treatment resulted in dose-dependent inhibition of IGF1R activation, suppression of IRS protein expression, inhibition of IGF-1-induced AKT activation, but increased ERK activation in NT157-treated cells in vitro. These effects were correlated with decreased proliferation and increasing apoptosis of LNCaP cells and increasing G2M arrest in PC3 cells. NT157 also suppressed androgen-responsive growth, delayed CRPC progression of LNCaP xenografts and suppressed PC3 tumor growth alone and in combination with docetaxel. This study reports the first preclinical proof-of-principle data that this novel small-molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor suppresses IRS1/2 expression, delays CRPC progression, and suppresses growth of CRPC tumors in vitro and in vivo. Demonstration that IRS expression can be increased in response to a variety of stressors that may lead to resistance or reduced effect of the therapies indicate that NT157-mediated IRS1/2 down-regulation is a novel therapeutic approach for management of advanced prostate cancer."
958,"Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography: utilization and usefulness in suspected choledocholithiasis."
959,"BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to evaluate the role of magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography in cases of suspected choledocholithiasis. METHODS: Suitable candidates were recruited from a database of all consecutive patients who underwent magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography between March 2009 and December 2012. Patients were stratified into low, medium and high risk for choledocholithiasis by assessing clinical symptoms, liver function tests and ultrasonography. True negatives and false positives were calculated based on endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography, intraoperative cholangiogram and clinical follow-up. RESULTS: Of 201 magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography investigations conducted, choledocholithiasis was diagnosed in 37 (18%) patients. In total, there was one false negative and three false positives. Total sensitivity and specificity values were 97% and 98%, respectively. These values were highest among low-risk patients (100% for both sensitivity and specificity). By initially opting for magnetic resonance imaging in suitable moderate- and high-risk patients, unnecessary endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography procedures were avoided in 61% and 65% of patients, respectively. CONCLUSION: Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography for patients with suspected choledocholithiasis yields high sensitivity and specificity. Given its reduced risk profile and relative ease of administration, magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography is a necessary tool for the assessment of choledocholithiasis with the capacity to rival gold standard diagnostic techniques and help reduce the number of unnecessary interventional procedures."
960,"Effects of job rotation on musculoskeletal complaints and related work exposures: a systematic literature review."
961,"The aim of this systematic review was to summarise evidence on the effects of job rotation on musculoskeletal complaints, exposures related to musculoskeletal complaints and sustainable working life parameters. A total of 16 studies were included. No studies on sustainable working life parameters were found. The quality of the studies was assessed using a checklist; eight field studies and three laboratory studies of sufficient quality were used to summarise the following evidence: one field study showed positive results and one field study showed negative results for musculoskeletal complaints, two field studies showed positive results and two field studies showed inconsistent results for exposures, and two field studies showed inconsistent results for musculoskeletal complaints and exposures. Two laboratory studies showed inconsistent results and one laboratory study showed no changes for exposures. In conclusion, there is currently inconsistent evidence for positive or negative effects of job rotation on musculoskeletal complaints and exposures related to musculoskeletal complaints. Practitioner's Summary: Currently, there is inconsistent evidence for recommending job rotation as a strategy for preventing musculoskeletal complaints. Exposures from all involved work activities and body regions should be identified and assessed first, to determine if job rotation provides increased exposure variation and/or beneficial changes in mean exposures related to musculoskeletal complaints."

967,"BACKGROUND: Propylthiouracil (PTU), an anti-thyroid thioureylene, has been shown to be effective in chronic plaque psoriasis. Involucrin is a precursor protein that is upregulated in psoriasis. OBJECTIVES: This study evaluated the expression of involucrin in the epidermis of skin in psoriatic plaques before and after treatment with PTU. METHODS: This was an open-label, prospective study in which 25 psoriasis patients underwent skin biopsies prior to treatment with oral PTU 100 mg three times per day for 12 weeks. Patients were assessed at 2, 6, and 12 weeks. Skin biopsies were repeated at the same sites at 12 weeks. Pre- and post-treatment specimens were subjected to immunohistochemical staining and real-time polymerase chain reaction for involucrin. RESULTS: Mean +/- standard deviation (SD) scores on the Psoriasis Area and Severity Index reduced significantly from 17.86 +/- 9.9 at baseline to 4.63 +/- 4.1 at week 12 (P < 0.001). Histomorphometric analysis revealed marked decreases in numbers of positively stained cells and intensity of staining. Staining became localized to the upper granular layers after therapy. Immunohistochemical scoring for involucrin reduced from a mean +/- SD of 9.00 +/- 0.67 at baseline to 3.90 +/- 0.88 at week 12 (P < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: In psoriasis, there is increased expression of involucrin, which leads to abnormal keratinocyte differentiation and hence to the formation of psoriatic plaques. The therapeutic effect of PTU in psoriasis may be attributable to the downregulation of involucrin. Larger trials should further elucidate the mechanism and therapeutic potential of PTU in psoriasis."
968,"Markers of stress and inflammation as potential mediators of the relationship between exercise and depressive symptoms: Findings from the TRAILS study."
969,"The hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, autonomic nervous system, and immune system have been proposed to underlie the antidepressant effect of exercise. Using a population sample of 715 adolescents, we examined whether pathways from exercise to affective and somatic symptoms of depression were mediated by these putative mechanisms. Exercise (hours/week) and depressive symptoms were assessed at age 13.5 (+/- 0.5) and 16.1 (+/- 0.6). Cortisol and heart rate responses to a standardized social stress test and C-reactive protein levels were measured at age 16. Exercise was prospectively and inversely related to affective (B = -0.16, 95% CI = -0.30 to -0.03) but not somatic symptoms (B = -0.04, 95% CI = -0.21 to 0.13). Heart rate during social stress partially mediated this relationship (B = -0.03, 95% CI = -0.07 to -0.01). No other mediating effects were found. Hence, the autonomic stress system may play a role in the relationship between exercise and depressive symptoms."
970,"Comparison of the platelet-rich plasma and buffy coat protocols for preparation of canine platelet concentrates."
971,"BACKGROUND: Platelet (PLT) concentrates (PC) can be produced via the buffy coat (BC) or platelet-rich plasma (PRP) protocols. The 2 methods have not been compared with canine blood. OBJECTIVES: The aims of the study were to compare the PLT, WBC, and RBC concentrations, in vitro PLT function, and markers of platelet storage lesion (PSL) in canine PC generated by 2 different protocols, and determine microbial growth throughout storage. METHODS: PC from 8 healthy donor dogs were produced using 2 standard protocols, PRP and BC. PLT, WBC, and RBC counts, optical aggregometry assays, and PSL markers (pH, pCO2 , HCO3 , lactate and glucose concentrations, and LDH activity) were determined on storage days 0, 1, 3, 5, and 7. Aerobic and anaerobic bacterial cultures were also performed. RESULTS: Mean PLT counts were comparable between protocols and remained stable throughout storage up to day 7, while median WBC and RBC counts on day 0 were significantly higher in the BC-PC group (17,800 WBCs/muL; 195,000 RBCs/muL) than in the PRP-PC group (200 WBCs/muL; 10,000 RBCs/muL) (P = .012). In PRP-PC aggregometry, the median slope and amplitude in response to gamma-thrombin and convulxin (+ ADP) were significantly decreased, and virtually absent in BC-PC during storage. PSL markers (lactate, LDH activity) were higher in BC-PC. Aerobic bacterial growth was observed in 2 PRP-PC and 1 BC-PC. CONCLUSIONS: This in vitro study suggests that PRP-PC had lesser WBC and RBC contamination and superior PLT function compared with BC-PC. In vivo studies are required to address safety and efficacy of PRP-PC."
972,"The Role of Cytokine Responses During Influenza Virus Pathogenesis and Potential Therapeutic Options."
973,"Aberrant pulmonary immune responses are linked to the pathogenesis of multiple human respiratory viral infections. Elevated cytokine and chemokine production ""cytokine storm"" has been continuously associated with poor clinical outcome and pathogenesis during influenza virus infection in humans and animal models. Initial trials using global immune suppression with corticosteroids or targeted neutralization of single inflammatory mediators proved ineffective to ameliorate pathology during pathogenic influenza virus infection. Thus, it was believed that cytokine storm was either chemically intractable or not causal in the pathology observed. During this review, we will discuss the history of research assessing the roles various cytokinesCytokines , chemokines, and innate immune cellsInnate immune cells play in promoting pathology or protection during influenza virus infection. Several promising new strategies modulating lipid signalingLipid signaling have been recently uncovered for global blunting, but not ablation, of innate immune responses following influenza virus infection. Importantly, modulating lipid signaling through various means has proven effective at curbing morbidity and mortality in animal models and may be useful for curbing influenza virus induced pathology in humans. Finally, we highlight future research directions for mechanistically dissecting how modulation of lipid signaling pathways results in favorable outcomes following influenza virus infection."
974,"Generalized pustular psoriasis associated with Epstein-Barr virus."
975,"Generalized pustular psoriasis (GPP) is a rare and severe variant of psoriasis. We report a case of a 79-year-old woman who presented with generalized pustular psoriasis and significant Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) viraemia. Serial measurements of EBV DNA showed a correlation with the deterioration in her clinical condition. We speculate that EBV reactivation triggered the development of GPP, and propose that further investigation is required into the association between EBV and GPP."
976,"Evaluation of the minimum volume of salvage blood required for the successful use of two different autotransfusion devices."
977,"BACKGROUND: Autotransfusion in pediatric anesthesia is beneficial in several clinical settings; however, more frequent usage is deterred by process-related costs and the fact that the absolute volume of blood returned may be minimal. OBJECTIVE: Two autotransfusion devices (CATS, Fresenius Kabi AG, and Sorin Xtra, Sorin GmbH) with different technologies were evaluated to determine the minimum volume necessary to efficiently process salvage blood. METHODS: Banked blood was diluted to simulate different clinical scenarios. Volume and red cell mass in returned blood were analyzed as a function of initial volume and red cell mass in the collection reservoir using incremental increases in the volume of blood added to the reservoir. RESULTS: The volume of the returned processed blood for infusion was dependent on degree of dilution and blood volume in the reservoir. The CATS required a smaller initial minimum volume to process and successfully return; however, the Xtra provided a more efficient recovery at low initial collected volumes. Using test blood of various degrees of dilution, the CATS and Xtra were able to return blood for retransfusion after a mean initial red cell mass of 48.7 ml (+/-4.9 ml) and 53.7 ml (+/-5.0 ml) were processed, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Red cell mass rather than salvaged blood volume represents a reliable predictor of the successful use of an autotransfusion device. Measuring the hematocrit of the salvaged blood could improve the use of the devices. The investigated devices are likely to be roughly equivalent in effectiveness."
978,"Serum ubiquitin via CXC chemokine receptor 4 triggered cyclooxygenase-1 ubiquitination possibly involved in the pathogenesis of aspirin resistance."
979,"Extracellular ubiquitin (Ub) with platelet aggregation property was found higher in acute myocardial infarction (AMI) patients. Here we detected the platelet functions and serum Ub levels in 250 AMI patients and 50 healthy volunteers before and after aspirin treatment. The influence of serum Ub on platelet functions was determined in vitro. We found that 47 out of 250 AMI patients showed aspirin resistance (AR) and 203 showed aspirin sensitivity (AS). During hospitalization, AR group had higher serum Ub levels than the AS group or the healthy group, and the serum Ub levels was related to the rates of thrombosis events. The patients with higher serum Ub levels showed that the platelets had more ubiquitinated platelets, higher contents of ubiquitinated proteins and ubiquitinated cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1). The levels of ubiquitinated COX-1 in the platelets was inversely correlated with acetylated COX-1, the separated ubiquitinated COX-1 activity was approximately twofold or fourfold higher than the total COX-1(ubiquitinated COX-1 and COX-1) or COX-1. In vitro, we found that extracellular Ub, via the CXC chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4) pathway, facilitated COX-1 to be ubiquitined and prevented aspirin to acetylate its target. Platelets had higher levels of ubiquitinated COX-1 showing poor response to aspirin. Such results were not detected in Ub-free serum or ovalbumin incubated platelets. Serum Ub, via the CXCR4 pathway, facilitated COX-1 to be ubiquitined and activated the platelets possibly involved in the pathogenesis of AR."
980,"The role of VTIQ as a new tissue strain analytics measurement in testicular lesions."
981,"PURPOSE: Virtual touch tissue imaging quantification (VTIQ) is a newly developed technique for the sonographic quantification of tissue elasticity. It has been used in the assessment of breast lesions. The purpose of this study was to determine the diagnostic performance of VTIQ in indeterminate testicular lesions. METHODS: Twenty patients with known testicular pathology underwent conventional B-mode sonography with additional VTIQ of the testicular lesions using a Siemens Acuson S2000 and S3000 (Siemens Medical Solutions, Mountain View, CA, USA) system. Tissue mechanical properties were analysed in the VTIQ examination. The pathologic diagnosis was established after surgery or in the follow-up examination for suspected benign lesions. RESULTS: Over 36 months, 22 focal testicular lesions (median lesion size, 18 mm; range, 4-36 mm in 20 patients (median age, 43 years; range, 22-81 years) were examined. Lesions were hyperechoic (n = 1), hypoechoic (n = 14), isoechoic (n = 1), of mixed echogenicity (n = 3) or anechoic (n = 3). Histological examination showed one benign lesion (6.25%) with a mean size of 7 mm and 15 malignant lesions (93.75%) with a mean size of 20 mm. Mean shear wave velocity for normal testicular tissue was 1.17 m/s. No value of the shear wave velocity could be measured in cystic lesions. The rest of the benign lesions showed a mean shear wave velocity of 2.37 m/s. The value of the shear wave velocity in germ cell tumours showed a mean shear wave velocity of 1.94 m/s and for seminoma it showed a mean shear wave velocity of 2.42 m/s. CONCLUSIONS: VTIQ is a reliable new method for measuring qualitative and quantitative stiffness of testis lesions and tissue. The qualitative shear-wave elastography features were highly reproducible and showed good diagnostic performance in unclear testicular lesions. The VTIQ technique is also useful in assessing small testicular nodules and pseudo lesions."
982,"The effect of exercise on blood fluidity: Use of the capillary model to assess the clogginess of blood."
983,"AIM: The goal was to evaluate the effects of exercise on the clogginess of blood as well as the effect of increased blood cell count and hematocrit levels after exercise. We also investigated the mechanisms underlying the clogginess of blood. METHODS: The time required for blood to pass through microchannels was measured. We focused on assessing the consecutive passage times for serial 20 muL volumes. We used heparinized peripheral blood obtained from subjects after exercise conducted at three intensity levels. Blood samples were also adjusted to achieve specific hematocrit levels or supplemented by addition of adenosine diphosphate (ADP). RESULTS: The sequential blood passage times of consecutive 20 muL volumes increased with platelet aggregation and adhesion of white blood cells (WBC). We also observed an increase with blood cell counts and hematocrit levels. These changes occurred after high intensity exercise but not after low or medium intensity exercise. Furthermore, the sequential blood passage times of 20 muL volumes increased with platelet aggregation and adhesion of WBC at an ADP concentration at the threshold of aggregation but not at higher levels of hematocrit. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggested that high intensity exercise might induce the clogginess of blood by enhanced platelet aggregation and adhesion of WBC."
984,"Impact of Di(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate on migration rate of human promyelocytic leukemia cells (HL-60)."
985,"INTRODUCTION: Softeners like phthalate esters are ubiquitous in the environment and have been detected in transfusion bags, though there is only a limited amount of studies on the effect of phthalates on blood cells. This study seeks to determine effects on cell migration of human promyelocytic leukemia cells (HL-60) incubated with di(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate (DEHP) at concentrations found in blood bags. MATERIAL AND METHODS: HL-60 cells were incubated with DEHP concentrations ranging from 0.1 mug/ml to 1000 mug/ml, diluted in DMSO, over 24 h, 48 h, and 72 h. Migration rate was analyzed along an SDF-1alpha gradient using Transwell migration inserts. RESULTS: Of the applied concentrations 100 mug/ml, 250 mug/ml, 500 mug/ml, and 1000 mug/ml showed a significant decrease in migration rates relative to DMSO control at all measuring points (p < 0.05), with relative migration rates between 37.87 % for 100 mug/ml and 25.34 % for 1000 mug/ml relative to DMSO after 24 h of stimulation and 19.73 % for 100 mug/ml and 14.69 % for 1000 mug/ml respectively after 72 h of incubation. CONCLUSION: Our results indicate HL-60 to be a suitable in vitro model for examining effects of DEHP on the migration of blood and nucleated cells at concentrations found in blood bags."
986,"Correlation of axial blood velocity to venular and arteriolar diameter in the human eye in vivo."
987,"The axial blood velocity (Vax) association with microvessel diameter (D) was studied at 104 different postcapillary venules (4 mum < D < 24 mum) and 30 different precapillary arterioles (6 mum </= D </= 12 mum) in the human conjunctiva of normal healthy humans. Venular diameter sizes were classified as ""very small"" (Group 1, 4.4 mum </= D < 8.9 mum), ""small"" (Group 2, 8.9 mum </= D < 13.8 mum), ""medium"" (Group 3, 13.8 mum </= D < 19.1 mum) and ""large"" (Group 4, 19.1 mum </= D </= 23.5). The Spearman's correlation coefficient (rs) in all 4 venular groups was less than 0.36 and not statistically significant (n = 26, p >/= 0.08). Similar correlation results were observed for the arteriolar group (rs) approximately 0) for the peak systolic, the average and the end systolic axial velocities. Vax was significantly (p < 0.001) lower in Group 1 in comparison to that in Group 2 and significantly (p < 0.01) lower in Group 2 in comparison to that in Group 3. However, Vax was not significantly lower in Group 3 in comparison to that in Group 4. Average Vax and standard deviation was 0.48 +/- 0.13, 0.64 +/- 0.16, 0.82 +/- 0.25 and 0.88 +/- 0.32 mm/s for Groups 1, 2, 3 and 4 respectively. The above results reinforce the importance of measuring D in microvascular hemodynamics. Higher diameters suggest higher axial velocities but Vax does not change significantly within the limits of each of the aforementioned groups."
988,"Pharmacokinetic and Pharmacodynamic Drug Interactions with Ethanol (Alcohol)."
989,"Ethanol (alcohol) is one of the most widely used legal drugs in the world. Ethanol is metabolized by alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) and the cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2E1 drug-metabolizing enzyme that is also responsible for the biotransformation of xenobiotics and fatty acids. Drugs that inhibit ADH or CYP2E1 are the most likely theoretical compounds that would lead to a clinically significant pharmacokinetic interaction with ethanol, which include only a limited number of drugs. Acute ethanol primarily alters the pharmacokinetics of other drugs by changing the rate and extent of absorption, with more limited effects on clearance. Both acute and chronic ethanol use can cause transient changes to many physiologic responses in different organ systems such as hypotension and impairment of motor and cognitive functions, resulting in both pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic interactions. Evaluating drug interactions with long-term use of ethanol is uniquely challenging. Specifically, it is difficult to distinguish between the effects of long-term ethanol use on liver pathology and chronic malnutrition. Ethanol-induced liver disease results in decreased activity of hepatic metabolic enzymes and changes in protein binding. Clinical studies that include patients with chronic alcohol use may be evaluating the effects of mild cirrhosis on liver metabolism, and not just ethanol itself. The definition of chronic alcohol use is very inconsistent, which greatly affects the quality of the data and clinical application of the results. Our study of the literature has shown that a significantly higher volume of clinical studies have focused on the pharmacokinetic interactions of ethanol and other drugs. The data on pharmacodynamic interactions are more limited and future research addressing pharmacodynamic interactions with ethanol, especially regarding the non-central nervous system effects, is much needed."
990,"A Comparative Analysis of Static Balance Between Patients With Lumbar Spinal Canal Stenosis and Asymptomatic Participants."
991,"OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to assess static balance in patients with lumbar spinal canal stenosis who qualified for surgical decompression of associated neural structures and compare them with asymptomatic participants. METHODS: This case-controlled study evaluated a sample of 50 patients with spinal canal stenosis (stenosis group) and 48 participants with no history of clinical symptoms of back pain. Static balance was assessed by conducting quantitative analysis of balance reaction parameters in quiet standing with the eyes closed. RESULTS: Higher values were observed in total length of center of pressure (COP) path, length of COP path in the anterior-posterior plane, mean amplitude of COP projection in the anterior-posterior plane, maximal amplitude between the 2 most distant points in the anterior-posterior plane, mean COP velocity, and sway area marked by the moving COP in the stenosis group compared with the asymptomatic group. CONCLUSIONS: This study showed statistically significant differences in static balance parameters between patients with spinal canal stenosis compared with the asymptomatic group."
992,"Safety, efficacy, and pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics of daclizumab (anti-CD25) in patients with adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma."
993,"Interleukin-2 receptor alpha chain (CD25) is overexpressed in human T-cell leukemia virus 1 associated adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATL). Daclizumab a humanized monoclonal antibody blocks IL-2 binding by recognizing the interleukin-2 receptor alpha chain (CD25). We conducted a phase I/II trial of daclizumab in 34 patients with ATL. Saturation of surface CD25 on circulating ATL cells was achieved at all doses; however saturation on ATL cells in lymph nodes required 8mg/kg. Up to 8mg/kg of daclizumab administered every 3weeks was well tolerated. No responses were observed in 18 patients with acute or lymphoma ATL; however, 6 partial responses were observed in 16 chronic and smoldering ATL patients. The pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics of daclizumab suggest that high-dose daclizumab would be more effective than low-dose daclizumab in treatment of lymphoid malignancies and autoimmune diseases (e.g., multiple sclerosis) since high-dose daclizumab is required to saturate IL-2R alpha in extravascular sites."
994,"Bordetella pertussis: an underreported pathogen in pediatric respiratory infections, a prospective cohort study."
995,"BACKGROUND: The incidence of pertussis has been increasing worldwide. In the Netherlands, the seroprevalence has risen higher than the reported cases, suggesting that laboratory tests for pertussis are considered infrequently and that even more pertussis cases are missed. The objective of our study was to determine the frequency of pertussis in clinically unsuspect cases compared to suspect cases with the intention of finding clinical predictors. METHODS: The present prospective cohort study was part of a controlled clinical trial evaluating the impact of molecular diagnostics on clinical decision making in pediatric respiratory infections, performed during 2 winter seasons. For this study, in the first season pertussis was only tested in case of clinical suspicion, in the second season, pertussis was also tested without clinical suspicion. Multivariate and univariate analysis were performed using SPSS 18 and Statistical software 'R'. RESULTS: In the two seasons respectively 22/209 (10,5%) and 49/373 (13,1%) cases were clinically suspected of pertussis. Bordetella pertussis was detected by real time RT-PCR in respectively 2/22 (9,1%) and 7/49 (14,3%) cases. In the second season an additional 7 cases of pertussis were found in clinically unsuspected cases (7/257 = 2,7%). These additional cases didn't differ in clinical presentation from children without a positive test for pertussis with respect to respiratory symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Pertussis in children sometimes mimics viral respiratory tract infections. If pertussis diagnostics are based on clinical suspicion alone, about 1 in 5 cases (19%) is missed. Despite widely accepted clinical criteria, paroxysmal cough is not a good predictor of pertussis. To prevent spreading, physicians should include B. pertussis in routine diagnostics in respiratory tract infections."
996,"Immunomodulation in Stem Cell Differentiation into Neurons and Brain Repair."
997,"Immunomodulators regulate stem cell activity at all stages of development as well as during adulthood. Embryonic stem cell (ESC) proliferation as well as neurogenic processes during embryonic development are controlled by factors of the immune system. We review here immunophenotypic expression patterns of different stem cell types, including ESC, neural (NSC) and tissue-specific mesenchymal stem cells (MSC), and focus on immunodulatory properties of these cells. Immune and inflammatory responses, involving actions of cytokines as well as toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling are known to affect the differentiation capacity of NSC and MSC. Secretion of pro- and anti-inflammatory messengers by MSC have been observed as the consequence of TLR and cytokine activation and promotion of differentiation into specified phenotypes. As result of augmented differentiation capacity, stem cells secrete angiogenic factors including vascular endothelial growth factor, resulting in multifactorial actions in tissue repair. Immunoregulatory properties of tissue specific adult stem cells are put into the context of possible clinical applications."
998,"Translational ethics: an analytical framework of translational movements between theory and practice and a sketch of a comprehensive approach."
999,"BACKGROUND: Translational research in medicine requires researchers to identify the steps to transfer basic scientific discoveries from laboratory benches to bedside decision-making, and eventually into clinical practice. On a parallel track, philosophical work in ethics has not been obliged to identify the steps to translate theoretical conclusions into adequate practice. The medical ethicist A. Cribb suggested some years ago that it is now time to debate 'the business of translational' in medical ethics. Despite the very interesting and useful perspective on the field of medical ethics launched by Cribb, the debate is still missing. In this paper, I take up Cribb's invitation and discuss further analytic distinctions needed to base an ethics aiming to translate between theory and practice. DISCUSSION: The analytic distinctions needed to base an ethics aiming to translate between theory and practice are identified as 'movements of translation'. I explore briefly what would constitute success and limitations to these intended translational movements by addressing the challenges of the epistemological gap between philosophical and practical ethics. The categories of translational movements I suggest can serve as a starting point for a systematic, collective self-inspection and discussion of the merits and limitations of the various academic and practical activities that bioethicists are engaged in. I further propose that translational ethics could be considered as a new discipline of ethical work constructively structured around compositions of translational movements. SUMMARY: Breaking the idea of translational ethics into distinct translational movements provide us with a nuanced set of conditions to explore and discuss the justification and limitations of various efforts carried out in the field of bioethics. In this sense, the proposed framework could be a useful vehicle for augmented collective, self-reflexivity among both philosophers and practitioners who are 'doing bioethics'. Also, carefully designed, overall approaches combining justified, self-reflexive philosophical and practical efforts according to the suggested distinctions could be expected to realise - or at least improve a facilitation of - translation of ethics across the theory-practice gap."
1000,"Results of cementless humeral head resurfacing with cemented glenoid components."
1001,"PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to analyse the short- and medium-term clinical and radiographic results of cementless humeral head resurfacing in combination with a cemented glenoid component. METHODS: Thirty-five patients with a mean age of 65 years (range 42-84) and a mean follow-up of three years (two to six) were followed up. The Constant score with its subgroups as well as shoulder motions and complications were recorded. Radiographs in two planes were analysed for loosening of the components. RESULTS: Mean Constant score improved from 29 points (6-63) to 70 points (41-89; p < 0.001). Mean shoulder flexion increased from 89 degrees (20-170) to 158 degrees (100-180) and mean external rotation from 10 degrees (-10-30) to 39 degrees (10-80). Satisfaction rate was 94 % at final follow-up. None of the components was found to be loose. There were three neurological complications, probably related to increased forces on the humeral head retractor during glenoid preparation. Two of them resolved completely; in one patient hyposensitivity remained. CONCLUSION: Cementless humeral surface replacement arthroplasty in combination with a cemented glenoid component leads to an overall satisfactory clinical outcome. However, the high rate of neurological complications found in this study, probably related to difficult glenoid exposure, led us to discontinue this implant configuration."
1002,"Nerve branches to the posterior cricoarytenoid muscle may complicate the laryngeal reinnervation procedure."
1003,"OBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESIS: To better understand the reason for the low success rate of posterior cricoarytenoid (PCA) muscle reinnervation, we attempted to identify the communicating branches that may exist between the nerve branch to the PCA muscle and the other laryngeal adductors in addition to the interarytenoid (IA) muscle. STUDY DESIGN: Quantitative histological assessment. METHODS: Twenty human hemilarynges from patients with laryngeal or hypopharyngeal cancer were obtained after surgery and stained with Sihler's stain, which rendered the muscle translucent while counterstaining the neuroanatomy of the recurrent laryngeal nerve (RLN) inside the larynges. RESULTS: The nerve supply to the PCA muscle was separated into two main branches. One upper branch supplied the horizontal compartment, and the lower branch supplied the vertical/oblique compartment. In 14 specimens, two nerve branches to the PCA muscle arose separately from the RLN. In six specimens, one single main branch arose from the RLN and immediately ramified into two secondary branches. In all specimens except one, the nerve branch to the horizontal compartment was connected to the IA muscle. However, no communicating branches were observed between the nerve to the PCA muscle and the other laryngeal adductors. No anastomosis between nerve branches to the horizontal and vertical/oblique compartments or other variations of nerve distribution were observed. CONCLUSIONS: The communicating branches between the nerve branches to the PCA muscle and the IA muscle may be the only branch, complicating the reinnervation procedure. More investigations are needed to identify variations in the terminal branch distribution from the RLN. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: NA Laryngoscope, 2014."
1004,"Clinically relevant aspects of stem cell technologies: current state of play."
1005,"The emergence of stem cell technologies and their potential applications in regenerative medicine have generated immense interest by both the lay public and clinicians. Unproven and unregulated cell-based therapies are commercially available both in Australia and internationally, and reports of patient uptake (stem cell tourism) and associated morbidity are increasingly frequent. Clinicians in all fields will require an enhanced understanding of the basic science principles and current state of play in regenerative medicine in order to effectively counsel patients regarding these therapies in the setting of both commercial ventures and clinical trials. This review aims to concisely highlight the key clinically pertinent features of these trials and briefly discuss the specific therapeutic potential, mechanism of action and risks associated with these variables."
1006,"A cricoid cartilage compression device for the accurate and reproducible application of cricoid pressure."
1007,"We describe the development and laboratory assessment of a refined prototype tactile feedback device for the safe and accurate application of cricoid pressure. We recruited 20 operating department practitioners and compared their performance of cricoid pressure on a training simulator using both the device and a manual unaided technique. The device significantly reduced the spread of the applied force: average (SE) root mean squared error decreased from 8.23 (0.48) N to 5.23 (0.32) N (p < 0.001). The average (SE) upwards bias in applied force also decreased, from 2.30 (0.74) N to 0.88 (0.48) N (p < 0.01). Most importantly, the percentage of force applications that deviated from target by more than 10 N decreased from 18% to 7% (p < 0.01). The device requires no prior training, is cheap to manufacture, is single-use and requires no power to operate, whilst ensuring that the correct force is always consistently applied."
1008,"Neuromodulation Integrating rTMS and Neurofeedback for the Treatment of Autism Spectrum Disorder: An Exploratory Study."
1009,"Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a pervasive developmental disorder characterized by deficits in social interaction, language, stereotyped behaviors, and restricted range of interests. In previous studies low frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) has been used, with positive behavioral and electrophysiological results, for the experimental treatment in ASD. In this study we combined prefrontal rTMS sessions with electroencephalographic (EEG) neurofeedback (NFB) to prolong and reinforce TMS-induced EEG changes. The pilot trial recruited 42 children with ASD (~14.5 years). Outcome measures included behavioral evaluations and reaction time test with event-related potential (ERP) recording. For the main goal of this exploratory study we used rTMS-neurofeedback combination (TMS-NFB, N = 20) and waitlist (WTL, N = 22) groups to examine effects of 18 sessions of integrated rTMS-NFB treatment or wait period) on behavioral responses, stimulus and response-locked ERPs, and other functional and clinical outcomes. The underlying hypothesis was that combined TMS-NFB will improve executive functions in autistic patients as compared to the WTL group. Behavioral and ERP outcomes were collected in pre- and post-treatment tests in both groups. Results of the study supported our hypothesis by demonstration of positive effects of combined TMS-NFB neurotherapy in active treatment group as compared to control WTL group, as the TMS-NFB group showed significant improvements in behavioral and functional outcomes as compared to the WTL group."
1010,"Evaluation of body composition parameters in patients with psoriasis."
1011,"BACKGROUND: Body composition parameters, such as weight, body mass index (BMI), and visceral fat rating, have been found to be associated with psoriasis. However, the associations of these parameters with psoriasis have not been demonstrated clearly. OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to evaluate body composition parameters in patients with psoriasis. METHODS: The relationships between the various body composition parameters and psoriasis were retrospectively examined in 242 patients with plaque psoriasis (119 women, 123 men) over a 2-year period during 2010-2012. In addition, the correlations between body composition parameters and Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) score were evaluated in treated and untreated patients with psoriasis. Patients were divided into two groups according to whether or not they had received systemic therapy within the previous three months. Body composition values were measured using the Tanita SC-330 Body Composition Analyzer(R) . RESULTS: Statistically significant differences were recorded in terms of weight (kg), body fat percentage, fat mass (kg), total body water (TBW) percentage, metabolic age, visceral fat rating, BMI, and degree of obesity among treated and untreated patients and control subjects. Differences in fat-free mass (FFM) (kg), muscle mass (kg), TBW (kg), and bone mass (kg) were found to be close to the limit for significance. The treated and untreated groups showed no significant differences in any of the parameters evaluated. The correlations between PASI score and the various parameters provided some evidence for such relationships. CONCLUSIONS: The present study provides evidence of a relationship between some body composition parameters and the occurrence of psoriasis. We suggest that body composition parameters should be analyzed not only in obese psoriasis patients but in all psoriasis patients upon their first diagnosis. Systemic therapy does not appear to cause any changes in body composition parameters."

1013,"Recently, we reported the properties of CD31-expressing cells in healthy individuals. However, the characteristics of CD31-expressing cells derived from coronary artery disease (CAD) patients remain unknown. This study aimed to investigate the relationship between circulating CD31+ cells and CAD as well as their biological characteristics. Analysis with flow cytometry revealed that CD31+ cells (C-CD31) from the peripheral blood (PB) of CAD patients exhibited low levels of T-cell marker and high levels of macrophage marker compared with the PB-CD31+ cells from healthy individuals (H-CD31). In addition, the expression levels of multiple pro-angiogenic and chemokine genes were significantly down-regulated in C-CD31. However, inflammatory gene IL-1alpha was highly up-regulated in C-CD31. Patients with unstable angina (UA) had significantly more CD31+ cells in the PB than healthy control group (P < 0.001). Moreover, there were significant correlations between the number of CD31+ cells and cardiovascular (CV) disease activity (R = 0.318, P = 0.006) and the number of diseased coronaries (R = 0.312, P = 0.005). For the diagnostic category of UA, the area under curve was 0.803 (P < 0.001). In conclusion, C-CD31 have impaired angiogenic potential and the number of circulating CD31+ cells were correlated with CV risk. These findings may contribute to the understanding of the pathogenesis of CAD."
1014,"Taspase1 cleaves MLL1 to activate cyclin E for HER2/neu breast tumorigenesis."
1015,"Taspase1, a highly conserved threonine protease, cleaves nuclear transcriptional regulators mixed-lineage leukemia (MLL, MLL1), MLL2, TFIIA, and ALF to orchestrate a wide variety of biological processes. In vitro studies thus far demonstrated that Taspase1 plays important roles in the proliferation of various cancer cell lines, including HER2-positive breast cancer cells. To investigate the role of Taspase1 in breast tumorigenesis in vivo, we deleted Taspase1 from mouse mammary glands by generating MMTV-neu;MMTV-cre;Tasp1F/- mice. We demonstrate that initiation of MMTV-neu- but not MMTV-wnt-driven breast cancer is blocked in the absence of Taspase1. Importantly, Taspase1 loss alone neither impacts normal development nor pregnancy physiology of the mammary gland. In mammary glands Taspase1 deficiency abrogates MMTV-neu-induced cyclins E and A expression, thereby preventing tumorigenesis. The mechanisms were explored in HER2-positive breast cancer cell line BT474 and HER2-transformed MCF10A cells and validated using knockdown-resistant Taspase1. As Taspase1 was shown to cleave MLL which forms complexes with E2F transcription factors to regulate Cyclins E, A, and B expression in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs), we investigated whether the cleavage of MLL by Taspase1 constitutes an essential in vivo axis for HER2/neu-induced mammary tumorigenesis. To this end, we generated MMTV-neu;MLLnc/nc transgenic mice that carry homozygous non-cleavable MLL alleles. Remarkably, these mice are also protected from HER2/neu-driven breast tumorigenesis. Hence, MLL is the primary Taspase1 substrate whose cleavage is required for MMTV-neu-induced tumor formation. As Taspase1 plays critical roles in breast cancer pathology, it may serve as a therapeutic target for HER2-positive human breast cancer.Cell Research advance online publication 30 September 2014; doi:10.1038/cr.2014.129."
1016,"Usefulness of free intraperitoneal air detected by CT scan in diagnosing bowel perforation in blunt trauma: Experience from a community-based hospital."
1017,"INTRODUCTION: Computed tomography (CT) scan has increasingly become the diagnostic modality of choice for the evaluation of patients with blunt abdominal trauma. CT scan is highly sensitive in the detection of small amounts of free intraperitoneal air (FIA). We aimed to evaluate the usefulness of FIA detected by CT scan in diagnosing bowel perforation in blunt trauma patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: All abdominal CT scans of blunt trauma patients who were treated at Al Rahba Hospital during the period from October 2010 till December 2013 were retrospectively reviewed. The results of abdominal CT scan were compared with the clinical follow up and operative findings to evaluate the sensitivity, specificity, predictive values, and usefulness index of CT-detected FIA in diagnosing bowel perforation. RESULTS: Abdominal CT scans were performed for 419 trauma patients. 21 (5%) patients were found to have FIA, two of them were true positive (10%), six (29%) needed mechanical ventilation, and eleven (52%) had a pneumothorax. 15/21 (71%) patients had multiple FIA pockets; the median (range) was 3 (2-10) air pockets. Two patients with multiple air pockets of 10mm-thick cuts or more had small bowel perforation. Six (29%) patients had a single air pocket of less than 10mm and none had bowel perforation. 398 patients had negative CT scan for FIA; two of them were false negative. CT-detected FIA scan had a sensitivity of 50% (95% CI: 6.8%-93.2%), specificity of 95.4% (95% CI: 92.9%-97.2%.), a positive predictive value of 9.5% (95% CI: 1.2%-30.4%) and a negative predictive value of 99.5% (95% CI: 98.2%-99.9%) for detecting bowel perforation. The usefulness index for abdominal CT scan FIA for detecting bowel perforation was 0.23 (not useful). CONCLUSIONS: Our study which stemmed from a community-based hospital showed that free intraperitoneal air found on abdominal CT scan of blunt trauma patients was an unreliable radiological finding for bowel perforation. The decision for laparotomy should be based on combined clinical and radiological findings. Conservative management with active observation may avoid unnecessary laparotomy."
1018,"Displaced acetabular fractures in the elderly: Results after open reduction and internal fixation."
1019,"BACKGROUND: The optimal management of elderly patients with displaced acetabular fractures remains controversial. This paper aims to summarize the clinical results of open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) and the possible factors influencing them. METHODS: Radiographic and clinical data on 52 elderly patients with displaced acetabular fractures that were treated by ORIF between May 2000 and May 2008 were retrospectively analysed. Data, such as fracture type (Letournel's classification system), quality of reduction, clinical outcomes (Harris hip score and modified Merle d'Aubigne-Postel score), and radiological outcomes (Matta score), were evaluated. RESULTS: Good to excellent clinical and radiological outcomes were recorded in 43 (82.7%) and 37 patients (71.2%), respectively. Acetabular fractures without radiographic features, such as quadrilateral plate fracture, Gull sign, posterior dislocation of hip, posterior wall marginal impaction, comminuted posterior wall fracture, and femoral head injury, can still achieve good to excellent outcomes. However, patients with the abovementioned radiographic features tend to achieve fair or poor outcomes. When an acetabular fracture with the aforementioned features, except for femoral head injury, can achieve and maintain anatomic reduction until complete fracture healing, the difference between fractures with and without the radiographic features is no longer significant. The results indicate that the outcomes are more affected by reduction rather than radiographic features. CONCLUSION: ORIF may be suggested for displaced acetabular fractures in the elderly. Good to excellent outcomes and a high degree of patient satisfaction can be achieved in majority of the patients. We recommend ORIF as the preferred treatment for displaced acetabular fractures without the abovementioned radiographic features. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Therapeutic level IV."
1020,"Review article: the intersection of mucosal pathophysiology in HIV and inflammatory bowel disease, and its implications for therapy."
1021,"BACKGROUND: The immunopathology of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) and HIV in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract can be viewed as ends of a spectrum with IBD being associated with 'immune excess' and HIV with 'immune paucity' within the GI tract. AIM: To review the pathophysiology of IBD and HIV as they intersect in the gut immune system. METHODS: A search was conducted in PubMed using defined keywords 'IBD, inflammatory bowel disease, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, HIV, innate immunity, mucosal layer, macrophage, cytokine, dendritic cells, adaptive immunity, CD4, T cells, Th1, Th2, natural killer T cells (NKT)'. RESULTS: Both the mucosal innate defence and adaptive immunity are profoundly affected by IBD and HIV. The pathophysiology of IBD and HIV with regard to mucosal barrier, macrophages, dendritic cells, NK cells, NKT cells and T-cell subsets is distinct yet closely interwoven. There is limited information on the clinical manifestations of patients who have both IBD and HIV. However, recent studies suggest that the clinical course of IBD may be attenuated by concurrent HIV infection - a premise that is reasonably supported by what is known of their pathophysiology. CONCLUSIONS: It is apparent that through specific pathophysiological mechanisms, HIV is capable of attenuating inflammation in IBD. In the absence of experimental models, further clinical studies are necessary to better understand patients with concurrent disease and decipher the clinical and mechanistic relationship between HIV and IBD at mucosal surfaces. Such studies are critical to guide therapeutic decisions in the management of patients with IBD infected with HIV."
1022,"Transcranial direct current stimulation of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex increased pain empathy."
1023,"Empathy for pain, a widely studied sub-form of empathy, is an ability to recognize and share pain of others. It involves brain regions associated with the emotional component of pain. Recent studies found that emotional pain could be modulated by stimulating the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) with transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS). We hypothesized that tDCS of the DLPFC could modulate empathy for pain as well. In the present study, healthy subjects were asked to watch pictures depicting somebody under painful or non-painful conditions and to evaluate the pain intensity of others as well as their own pain-related unpleasantness before and after tDCS of the DLPFC. It was found that ratings for others' pain increased in subjects with an anodal tDCS of the DLPFC in comparison to those with sham tDCS, indicating enhanced pain empathy with the anodal tDCS. Furthermore, the changes of ratings for others' pain were positively correlated with the changes of pain related self-unpleasantness. These findings indicate that tDCS could modulate pain empathy and be used as a potential tool for modulating diseases accompanied with empathy deficits."
1024,"Assessment of secondary radiation and radiation protection in laser-driven proton therapy."
1025,"This work is a feasibility study of a radiation treatment unit with laser-driven protons based on a state-of-the-art energy selection system employing four dipole magnets in a compact shielded beamline. The secondary radiation emitted from the beamline and its energy selection system and the resulting effective dose to the patient are assessed. Further, it is evaluated whether or not such a compact system could be operated in a conventional treatment vault for clinical linear accelerators under the constraint of not exceeding the effective dose limit of 1 mSv per year to the general public outside the treatment room. The Monte Carlo code Geant4 is employed to simulate the secondary radiation generated while irradiating a hypothetical tumor. The secondary radiation inevitably generated inside the patient is taken into account as well, serving as a lower limit. The results show that the secondary radiation emanating from the shielded compact therapy system would pose a serious secondary dose contamination to the patient. This is due to the broad energy spectrum and in particular the angular distribution of the laser-driven protons, which make the investigated beamline together with the employed energy selection system quite inefficient. The secondary radiation also cannot be sufficiently absorbed in a conventional linear accelerator treatment vault to enable a clinical operation. A promising result, however, is the fact that the secondary radiation generated in the patient alone could be very well shielded by a regular treatment vault, allowing the application of more than 100 fractions of 2Gy per day with protons. It is thus theoretically possible to treat patients with protons in such treatment vaults. Nevertheless, the results show that there is a clear need for alternative more efficient energy selection solutions for laser-driven protons."
1026,"Vulvar nevi, melanosis, and melanoma: An epidemiologic, clinical, and histopathologic review."
1027,"Pigmented vulvar lesions are present in approximately 1 in 10 women and include melanocytic and nonmelanocytic proliferations. Vulvar nevi, melanosis, and melanoma are particularly challenging because of the similarity of their clinical and/or histopathological presentation. As a result, they are often difficult to diagnose, may result in patient and physician anxiety, and can lead to unneeded, potentially disfiguring surgical procedures. Because it is often detected late, vulvar melanoma carries a poor prognosis with associated significant morbidity and mortality, underscoring the importance of prompt recognition and treatment. In this review, we analyze the distinct epidemiologic, clinical, and histopathologic characteristics of vulvar nevi, melanosis, and melanoma, discuss treatment options, and propose a practical, systematic approach to facilitate formulation of a differential diagnosis and initiation of appropriate management."
1028,"Diagnostic Approach to Retromolar Trigone Cancer by Multiplanar Computed Tomography Reconstructions."
1029,"Neoplasms of retromolar trigone have important peculiarities due to their spatial relationships with the surrounding structures. Tumours that involve this area can extend to nearby muscles; adipose spaces; and other anatomic structures, such as the soft palate, the tonsillar fossa, the parapharyngeal space, and the floor of the mouth. In spite of a relatively quick diagnosis, the real extent of these tumours is typically underestimated at clinical examination. Our purpose was to propose a systematic approach to the use of multiplanar computed tomography reconstructions to evaluate normal retromolar trigone anatomy and the main pathways of spread for tumours that arise in this area. To our knowledge, only few reports exist in literature about this topic and none are about the usefulness of multidetector computed tomography and multiplanar reconstructions."
1030,"Multisource Feedback and Self-Assessment of the Communicator, Collaborator, and Professional CanMEDS Roles for Diagnostic Radiology Residents."
1031,"PURPOSE: To develop a tool for the external and self-evaluation of residents in the Communicator, Collaborator, and Professional CanMEDS roles. METHODS: An academic teaching institution affiliated with 4 major urban hospitals conducted a survey that involved 46 residents and 216 hospital staff members. Residents selected at least 13 external evaluators from different categories (including physicians, nurses or technologists, peers or fellows, and support staff members) from their last 6 months of rotations. The external evaluators and residents answered 4 questions that pertained to each of the 3 CanMEDS roles being assessed. The survey results were analysed for feasibility, variance within and between rater groups, and the relationships between multisource and self-evaluation scores, and between multisource feedback and in-training evaluation report scores. RESULTS: The multisource feedback survey had an overall response rate of 73% with 683 evaluations sent out to 216 unique evaluators. The ratings from different groups of evaluators were only weakly correlated. Residents were most likely to receive their best rating from a collaborating physician and their worst rating from a site secretary or a program assistant. Generally, self-assessment scores were significantly lower than multisource feedback scores. Although there was a strong correlation within the multisource feedback data and within the in-training evaluation report data, there was a weak correlation among the data sets. CONCLUSIONS: Multisource feedback provides useful feedback and scores that relate to critical CanMEDS roles that are not necessarily reflected in a resident's in-training evaluation report. The self-assessment feature of multisource feedback permits a resident to compare the accuracy of his or her assessments to improve their life-long learning skills."

1035,"In this case series, we present the history and imaging of several male patients with breast complaints. Given the rise in men presenting with breast cancer, from 1 in 100,000 in the 1970s to 1.5 in 100,000 in 2012 [1,2], these cases presented here together provide the useful reminder that a comprehensive clinical history and focal physical examination is critical when assessing the symptomatic male (as well as female) patient with a breast complaint."
1036,"Role of polymerase chain reaction in breast tuberculosis."
1037,"BACKGROUND: Breast tuberculosis (TB) is an uncommon condition even in endemic countries. Breast abscess is usually seen in young females. PCR helps in such challenging cases to clinch the correct diagnosis. OBJECTIVE: The present study was performed to compare FNAC and TB PCR in inflammatory lesions of breast. METHODS: FNAC cases reported as breast abscess, necrosis, non-specific and granulomatous inflammation on cytology was taken. The material for PCR was obtained from archived MGG smears and PCR for Mycobacterium tuberculosis for insertion sequence IS6110 was performed. RESULTS: A total of 54 cases were studied. The age ranged from 19-55 years. On FNAC, acute suppurative inflammation without granulomas and negative AFB staining was noted in 18 cases; granulomatous inflammation/mastitis in 26 cases and granulomatous inflammation with necrosis with AFB positivity confirming tuberculosis in 10 cases. PCR for Mycobacterium tuberculosis for insertion sequence IS6110 was performed. None of the 18 cases of acute suppurative inflammation had positivity for PCR. 13/26 [53.3%] cases of granulomatous inflammation/ mastitis with AFB negativity were positive for PCR. 10/10 cases of granulomatous inflammation with necrosis with AFB positivity showed PCR positivity. Therefore, proven cases of TB after FNAC were only 10/54 [17.24%] and the sensitivity increased to 23/54 [42.6%] after performing PCR on FNA aspirate. CONCLUSION: PCR helped in identifying 13/26 [50%] cases reported as granulomatous inflammation on cytology as tuberculosis. FNAC acted as an efficient modality for collection of material for PCR. This study shows how PCR aids in diagnosis of breast TB."

1042,"Anamorelin HCl (ONO-7643), a novel ghrelin receptor agonist, for the treatment of cancer anorexia-cachexia syndrome: preclinical profile."
1043,"BACKGROUND: Anamorelin HCl (ANAM) is a novel, orally active, ghrelin receptor agonist in clinical development for the treatment of cancer cachexia. We report in vitro and in vivo studies evaluating the preclinical pharmacologic profile of ANAM. METHODS: Fluorescent imaging plate reader and binding assays in HEK293 and baby hamster kidney cells determined the agonist and antagonist activity of ANAM, and its affinity for the ghrelin receptor. Rat pituitary cells were incubated with ANAM to evaluate its effect on growth hormone (GH) release. In vivo, rats were treated with ANAM 3, 10, or 30 mg/kg, or control orally, once daily for 6 days to evaluate the effect on food intake (FI) and body weight (BW), and once to assess GH response. In pigs, single (3.5 mg/kg) or continuous (1 mg/kg/day) ANAM doses were administered to assess GH and insulin-like growth factor (IGF-1) response. RESULTS: ANAM showed significant agonist and binding activity on the ghrelin receptor, and stimulated GH release in vitro. In rats, ANAM significantly and dose-dependently increased FI and BW at all dose levels compared with control, and significantly increased GH levels at 10 or 30 mg/kg doses. Increases in GH and IGF-1 levels were observed following ANAM administration in pigs. CONCLUSION: ANAM is a potent and highly specific ghrelin receptor agonist with significant appetite-enhancing activity, leading to increases in FI and BW, and a stimulatory effect on GH secretion. These results support the continued investigation of ANAM as a potential treatment of cancer anorexia-cachexia syndrome."
1044,"Cost-Utility Analysis of Oral Anticoagulants for Nonvalvular Atrial Fibrillation Patients at the Police General Hospital, Bangkok, Thailand."
1045,"PURPOSE: The genetic polymorphism was one of the major considerations for adjusting doses of warfarin in Thai individuals. As a result, new oral anticoagulants (NOACs) were introduced to achieve therapeutic goals in stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation (SPAF) patients. However, a cost-utility analysis in a population-specific model was lacking in Thailand. This study was performed to determine which NOACs yielded population-specific, cost-effective results for SPAF compared with warfarin from both governmental and societal perspectives in Thailand. METHODS: A simplified Markov health state model was constructed to calculate the lifetime cost, life-years saved, and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) gained. Asia-specific clinical event parameters were defined from systematic searches of PubMed. Cost and utility input was obtained from hospital based data collection. FINDINGS: Although NOACs produced more life-years saved and QALYs gained resulting from the base-case versus warfarin, the lifetime costs of new alternatives increased to >1.4 times the comparative cost of warfarin. This caused an incremental cost-effective ratio that exceeded Thailand's cost-effectiveness threshold. The probabilistic sensitivity analysis denoted the robustness of our model and revealed that dose-adjusted warfarin was the most cost-effective option in >99% of iterations. NOACs produced cost-effective results when the medication unit cost was decreased by at least 85%. IMPLICATIONS: According to the results of this first cost-utility analysis in Thailand, warfarin is still the most cost-effective medication for SPAF from any perspective in Thailand at the threshold recommended by our health technology assessment guidelines."
1046,"Work-up and management of lone atrial fibrillation: results of the European Heart Rhythm Association Survey."
1047,"The purpose of this European Heart Rhythm Association (EHRA) survey was to explore the work-up and management of lone atrial fibrillation (AF) among the European centres. Thirty-two European centres, all members of the EHRA electrophysiology (EP) research network, responded to this survey and completed the list of questions. The prevalence of lone AF has been reported to be </=10% by 19 (60%) of the participating centres. The presence of isolated left atrial enlargement and left ventricular diastolic dysfunction represent heart disease according to 50 and 84% of the centres, respectively, and exclude the diagnosis of lone AF. Fifty-nine per cent of responders do not routinely consider genetic testing in lone AF patients. The initial therapeutic approach in symptomatic paroxysmal lone AF is antiarrhythmic drug therapy as reported by 31 (97%) of the centres. Pulmonary vein isolation only is the first ablation strategy for patients with symptomatic persistent lone AF at 27 (84%) of the responding centres. Assessment for sleep apnoea, obesity, and intensive sports activity in lone AF is performed at 27 (84%) centres. In conclusion, this EP Wire survey confirms that the term 'lone AF' is still used in daily practice. The work-up typically includes screening for known risk factors but not genetic testing. The preferred management of paroxysmal lone AF is rhythm control with antiarrhythmic drugs, whereas pulmonary vein isolation is the first ablation strategy for the majority of patients with symptomatic persistent lone AF."
1048,"Cortical hypermetabolism in MCI subjects: a compensatory mechanism?"
1049,"PURPOSE: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is associated with amyloid accumulation that takes place decades before symptoms appear. Cognitive impairment in AD is associated with reduced glucose metabolism. However, neuronal plasticity/compensatory mechanisms might come into play before the onset of dementia. The aim of this study was to determine whether there is evidence of cortical hypermetabolism as a compensatory mechanism before amyloid deposition takes place in subjects with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI). METHODS: Nine AD subjects and ten aMCI subjects had both [11C]PIB and [18F]FDG PET scans with arterial input in order to quantify the amyloid deposition and glucose metabolism in vivo in comparison with healthy control subjects who underwent either [11C]PIB or [18F]FDG PET scans. The [11C]PIB PET scans were quantified using [11C]PIB target region to cerebellum uptake ratio images created by integrating the activity collected from 60 to 90 min, and regional cerebral glucose metabolism was quantified using spectral analysis. RESULTS: In MCI subjects, cortical hypermetabolism was observed in four amyloid-negative subjects and one amyloid-positive subject, while hypometabolism was seen in five other MCI subjects with high amyloid load. Subjects with hypermetabolism and low amyloid did not convert to AD during clinical follow-up for 18 months in contrast to four amyloid-positive hypometabolic subjects who did convert to AD. CONCLUSION: This preliminary study suggests that compensatory hypermetabolism can occur in aMCI subjects, particularly in those who are amyloid-negative. The increase in metabolic rate in different cortical regions with predominance in the occipital cortex may be a compensatory response to the neuronal damage occurring early in the disease process. It may also reflect recruitment of relatively minimally affected cortical regions to compensate for reduced function in the temporoparietal cortical association areas."
1050,"MIBG scans in patients with stage 4 neuroblastoma reveal two metastatic patterns, one is associated with MYCN amplification and in MYCN-amplified tumours correlates with a better prognosis."
1051,"PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to find clinically relevant MIBG-avid metastatic patterns in patients with newly diagnosed stage 4 neuroblastoma. METHODS: Diagnostic 123I-MIBG scans from 249 patients (123 from a European and 126 from the COG cohort) were assessed for metastatic spread in 14 body segments and the form of the lesions: ""focal"" (clear margins distinguishable from adjacent background) or ""diffuse"" (indistinct margins, dispersed throughout the body segment). The total numbers of diffuse and focal lesions were recorded. Patients were then categorized as having lesions exclusively focal, lesions more focal than diffuse, lesions more diffuse than focal, or lesions exclusively diffuse. RESULTS: Diffuse lesions affected a median of seven body segments and focal lesions a median of two body segments (P < 0.001, both cohorts). Patients with a focal pattern had a median of 2 affected body segments and those with a diffuse pattern a median of 11 affected body segments (P < 0.001, both cohorts). Thus, two MIBG-avid metastatic patterns emerged: ""limited-focal"" and ""extensive-diffuse"". The median numbers of affected body segments in MYCN-amplified (MNA) tumours were 5 (European cohort) and 4 (COG cohort) compared to 9 and 11, respectively, in single-copy MYCN (MYCNsc) tumours (P < 0.001). Patients with exclusively focal metastases were more likely to have a MNA tumour (60 % and 70 %, respectively) than patients with the other types of metastases (23 % and 28 %, respectively; P < 0.001). In a multivariate Cox regression analysis, focal metastases were associated with a better event-free and overall survival than the other types of metastases in patients with MNA tumours in the COG cohort (P < 0.01). CONCLUSION: Two metastatic patterns were found: a ""limited and focal"" pattern found mainly in patients with MNA neuroblastoma that correlated with prognosis, and an ""extensive and diffuse"" pattern found mainly in patients with MYCNsc neuroblastoma."
1052,"Sex-Specific Effects of Cigarette Mentholation on Brain Nicotine Accumulation and Smoking Behavior."
1053,"Menthol cigarettes are likely associated with greater risks of smoking dependence than non-menthol cigarettes. We sought to test the hypothesis that menthol increases the rate of brain nicotine accumulation (BNA) during smoking and thereby enhances its addictive effects. In a counter-balanced cross-over design, 10 menthol and 9 non-menthol smokers (10 females and 9 males; mean age 44.3) underwent two study phases. In each phase the participant smoked exclusively either menthol or non-menthol research cigarettes for approximately 1 week prior to a Positron Emission Tomography (PET) scan session, during which the subject's head was scanned following inhalation of a single puff of smoke from a cigarette containing 11C-nicotine. No differences in initial slope, Cmax, area under curve (AUC), and T1/2 of BNA were found between menthol and non-menthol cigarettes across all subjects; however, menthol relative to non-menthol cigarettes were associated with steeper initial slopes in men (p =.008). Unexpectedly, women had faster BNA as indicated by greater values of the initial slope, Cmax, AUC and shorter T1/2 than men (all ps <.04). The rates of BNA were significantly correlated with ratings of smoking motivations of getting a ""rush"", getting relaxing effects and marginally with alleviation of craving. These results do not provide strong support for the putative role of menthol in enhancing BNA, although further studies should explore the apparent effect of menthol on BNA in men. Fast BNA during smoking and preference of sensory properties of menthol cigarettes may independently or jointly contribute to smoking dependence among women.Neuropsychopharmacology accepted article preview online, 30 September 2014; doi:10.1038/npp.2014.263."
1054,"Comparing speech characteristics in spinocerebellar ataxias type 3 and type 6 with Friedreich ataxia."
1055,"Patterns of dysarthria in spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs) and their discriminative features still remain elusive. Here we aimed to compare dysarthria profiles of patients with (SCA3 and SCA6 vs. Friedreich ataxia (FRDA), focussing on three particularly vulnerable speech parameters (speaking rate, prosodic modulation, and intelligibility) in ataxic dysarthria as well as on a specific oral non-speech variable of ataxic impairment, i.e., the irregularity of oral motor diadochokinesis (DDK). 30 Patients with SCA3, SCA6, and FRDA, matched for group size (n = 10 each), disease severity, and disease duration produced various speech samples and DDK tasks. A discriminant analysis was used to differentiate speech and non-speech parameters between groups. Regularity of DDK was specifically impaired in SCA3, whereas impairments of speech parameters, i.e., rate and modulation were stronger affected in SCA6. Speech parameters are particularly vulnerable in SCA6, while non-speech oral motor features are notably impaired in SCA3."
1056,"Perioperative use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs might impair dental implant osseointegration."
1057,"OBJECTIVE: To appraise whether adverse biological events following oral implant placement may be associated with perioperative use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). METHODS: All patients treated in a university faculty postgraduate dental clinic between 1979 and 2012 that had experienced a failing and surgically removed dental implant (292 implants in 168 patients) were contacted to solicit additional information about their present dental and medical status and frequency of current and past use of NSAIDs. Potential associations between perioperative NSAIDs use and the occurrence of adverse biological events were explored by the use of 2 x 2 tables and two-tailed Fisher's exact tests. RESULTS: One hundred and four patients with initially 468 implants had experienced 238 implant failures, of which 197 were due to failing osseointegration (42%). Sixty of the participants, initially with 273 implants, had used NSAIDs perioperatively and experienced 44% implant failures, versus 38% in the non-NSAID cohort. The NSAID cohort experienced 3.2 times more cases of radiographic bone loss greater than 30% of the vertical height of their remaining implants and 1.9 times more cases of cluster failures, defined as failure of 50% or more of the implant(s) placed. CONCLUSIONS: Notwithstanding that a retrospective study design is open to potential bias, the current data indicate that dental implant osseointegration may be affected negatively by an inhibitory effect of NSAIDs on bone healing in vulnerable patients. Future and better clinical studies than the current should be designed to appraise more precisely the potential effects of NSAIDs on implant osseointegration in study populations that are not limited by stringent medical inclusion and exclusion criteria."
1058,"Oral Corticosteroids and the Risk of Serious Infections in Patients With Elderly-Onset Inflammatory Bowel Diseases."
1059,"OBJECTIVES:Systemic corticosteroids are among the most common anti-inflammatory treatments in elderly-onset inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients. Steroid use and older age each independently predisposes to infections, and infections increase mortality in hospitalized older IBD patients. Therefore, our objective was to examine the risk of serious infections in elderly-onset IBD patients treated with oral corticosteroids, and explore how the timing of exposure affects the risk estimates.METHODS:Using the health-care databases of the province of Quebec, Canada, we conducted a population-based cohort study with a nested case-control analysis. Incident IBD patients aged >/=66 years were identified. Conditional logistic regression was performed to estimate crude and adjusted rate ratios (aRRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs).RESULTS:We identified 3,522 elderly-onset patients, of which 564 cases with serious infections were identified during a mean 4.4 years of follow-up (incidence rate 3.7 per 100 per year) and matched to 2,646 controls. The rate of serious infections was significantly higher in those exposed to oral corticosteroids any time during the previous 6-month period compared with those nonexposed (aRR 2.3; 95% CI 1.8-2.9). Those currently exposed (within 45 days) had a higher risk (aRR 2.8; 95% CI 2.1-3.7). The residual effect of oral corticosteroids remained marginally statistically significant up to the 90-day period before the index date (aRR 1.7; 95% CI 1.0-2.7).CONCLUSIONS:We found an excess relative risk for serious infections in elderly-onset IBD patients on oral corticosteroid therapy. Those with current exposure demonstrated a higher vulnerability to infections.Am J Gastroenterol advance online publication, 30 September 2014; doi:10.1038/ajg.2014.313."
1060,"Stability of Increased Adenoma Detection at Colonoscopy. Follow-Up of an Endoscopic Quality Improvement Program-EQUIP-II."
1061,"OBJECTIVES:We recently completed a randomized controlled trial of an endoscopic quality improvement program (EQUIP) that demonstrated an improved adenoma detection rate (ADR) through simple educational interventions. The aim of this study (phase III) is to examine whether the improvement in ADR in the trained endoscopists remained stable with further follow-up.METHODS:We prospectively followed up 15 staff endoscopists who had previously been randomized to a quality improvement intervention. In the current study, we examined an additional 1,200 colonoscopy procedures conducted over a 5-month time period following the original study, referred to as phase III. During this time, all physicians received quarterly ADR and other quality metric feedback, and the previous control group was offered the educational intervention voluntarily. ADRs and adenoma per patient (APP) rates were estimated in the endoscopists who were and were not randomized to EQUIP training and compared with those obtained in phases I and II of the original study. The study was conducted in a tertiary care Academic Medical Center. The study sample comprised 1200 patients undergoing routine colonoscopy. The main outcome measurement was adenoma detection rate.RESULTS:The previously observed increase in ADR in the trained group from 36% in phase I to 47% in phase II was maintained into phase III (46%). The ADR of the untrained group remained unchanged from phase I (36%) to phase II (35%); it was increased only marginally in phase III to 39%, which was still lower than the 46% ADR in the trained group. The trained group had an increase in APP, from 0.72 in Phase I to 0.87 in Phase II and 0.98 in Phase III. For the previously untrained group, there was no change in APP from phase I (0.68) to phase II (0.68), but there was possibly a small increase (to 0.74) in Phase III.CONCLUSIONS:This study provides evidence that improvements in ADR obtained through the endoscopic quality-training program can persist for at least 5 months after completion of the program. It further suggests that a focus on ADR does not lead to a ""one and done"" phenomenon. The limitations of this study were as follows: single-center setting, and lack of sessile polyp information/standardization.Am J Gastroenterol advance online publication, 30 September 2014; doi:10.1038/ajg.2014.314."
1062,"Patterns of changing cancer risks with time since diagnosis of a sibling."
1063,"Family history is a well-known risk factor for many cancers. However, it is important to know if/how the familial risk of cancer changes over time. For each of four major cancers (colorectal, breast, prostate and melanoma), we identified siblings of cancer patients (case siblings) and siblings of matched cancer-free controls sampled from Swedish population-based registers.. Effects of age and time since diagnosis on sibling risks were examined using Poisson regression and presented graphically as smoothed hazard ratios. Screening effects were investigated by comparing hazards before/after the introduction of mammography for breast cancer and prostate-specific-antigen (PSA) testing for prostate cancer. Case siblings had higher cancer incidence than control siblings for all cancers at all ages, with overall incidence rate ratios (IRRs) of 2.41 (95% confidence interval 2.14-2.71) for colorectal cancer, 2.37 (2.24-2.52) for breast cancer, 3.69 (3.46-3.93) for prostate cancer and 3.20 (2.72-3.76) for melanoma. Risks were highest in siblings who were young when the first cancer was diagnosed in the family, with siblings aged 30-40 having IRR 9.05 (3.03-27.00) for colorectal cancer and 4.30 (2.87-6.45) for breast cancer. Smoothed hazard ratios (HRs) remained fairly constant for up to 20-years except for prostate cancer, where the HR decreased steeply during the first few years. After introduction of PSA testing, men had higher incidence of prostate cancer shortly after diagnosis in a brother, but no such screening effect was found for breast cancer. Our findings can help inform the screening and counseling of family members of cancer patients. (c) 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc."
1064,"KRAS and BRAF mutational status in colon cancer from Albanian patients."
1065,"BackgroundNumerous clinical studies have shown that anti-EGFR therapies are effective only in a subset of patients with colorectal cancer. Mutations in the KRAS and BRAF genes have been confirmed as negative predictors of the response to EGFR-targeted therapies.In this study we evaluated KRAS and BRAF status in 159 colorectal cancer samples obtained from the University of Tirana.MethodsWe evaluated KRAS mutations in codons 12, 13, 61, 146 and in codon 600 of BRAF by direct sequencing.. 90 patients were male (57%) and 69 female (43%); the patients inverted question mark ages ranged from 17 to 85 (median 61.7). 24 patient were stage I, 36 stage II, 84 stage III and 15 stage IV.ResultsOut of the 159 cases, 28 (17,6%) showed KRAS mutation (13 G12D, 4 G12C, 4 G12V, 3 G12A, 2 G13 D, 1 G12S and 1 A146T), and 10 (6,3%) showed BRAF mutation (all V600E). No significant correlations between KRAS and BRAF mutations and various clinicopathological parameters was found.This is the first report of KRAS and BRAF status in Albanian patients with colorectal carcinoma (CRC) and though the relatively small sample size might not provide enough statistics power.ConclusionsThe results of KRAS and BRAF mutation analysis could be used in the selection of patients for anti-EGFR therapy.Virtual SlidesThe virtual slide(s) for this article can be found here: http://www.diagnosticpathology.diagnomx.eu/vs/13000_2014_187."
1066,"Patients' Perceptions of Health-related Quality of Life During and After Adjuvant Radiotherapy for T1N0M0 Breast Cancer."
1067,"AIMS: The effects of radiotherapy on health-related quality of life (HRQOL) may influence decisions about adjuvant radiotherapy after breast-conserving surgery. We sought women's ratings of HRQOL during and after radiotherapy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Women completed HRQOL measures before, during and after adjuvant radiotherapy for node-negative, hormone receptor-positive breast cancers that were less than 2 cm in size. Acute and late toxicities were rated by clinicians. RESULTS: There were 161 participants with a median age of 58 years (range 34-82). Mean scores for most aspects of HRQOL worsened only slightly during radiotherapy and improved to baseline levels or better within a few months. The symptoms rated as most distressing were: difficulty sleeping (29%), fatigue (23%), breast discolouration (21%), uncertainty about the future (18%), feeling sad or depressed (18%), feeling anxious or worried (19%). Most rated their experience as better (39%) or much better (28%) than expected. Grade 3 toxicities were rare (5% acute, 1% late) with no grade 4 toxicities. CONCLUSIONS: Radiotherapy was associated with transient and generally mild impairments in a few aspects of HRQOL. Concerns about adverse effects on HRQOL should not weigh heavily on decisions about adjuvant breast radiotherapy."
1068,"A matrix metalloproteinase mediates long-distance attenuation of stem cell proliferation."
1069,"Ligand-based signaling can potentiate communication between neighboring cells and between cells separated by large distances. In the Drosophila melanogaster ovary, Wingless (Wg) promotes proliferation of follicle stem cells located approximately 50 microm or five cell diameters away from the Wg source. How Wg traverses this distance is unclear. We find that this long-range signaling requires Division abnormally delayed (Dally)-like (Dlp), a glypican known to extend the range of Wg ligand in the wing disc by binding Wg. Dlp-mediated spreading of Wg to follicle stem cells is opposed by the extracellular protease Mmp2, which cleaved Dlp in cell culture, triggering its relocalization such that Dlp no longer contacted Wg protein. Mmp2-deficient ovaries displayed increased Wg distribution, activity, and stem cell proliferation. Mmp2 protein is expressed in the same cells that produce Wg; thus, niche cells produce both a long-range stem cell proliferation factor and a negative regulator of its spreading. This system could allow for spatial control of Wg signaling to targets at different distances from the source."
1070,"Cdc42 and formin activity control non-muscle myosin dynamics during Drosophila heart morphogenesis."
1071,"During heart formation, a network of transcription factors and signaling pathways guide cardiac cell fate and differentiation, but the genetic mechanisms orchestrating heart assembly and lumen formation remain unclear. Here, we show that the small GTPase Cdc42 is essential for Drosophila melanogaster heart morphogenesis and lumen formation. Cdc42 genetically interacts with the cardiogenic transcription factor tinman; with dDAAM which belongs to the family of actin organizing formins; and with zipper, which encodes nonmuscle myosin II. Zipper is required for heart lumen formation, and its spatiotemporal activity at the prospective luminal surface is controlled by Cdc42. Heart-specific expression of activated Cdc42, or the regulatory formins dDAAM and Diaphanous caused mislocalization of Zipper and induced ectopic heart lumina, as characterized by luminal markers such as the extracellular matrix protein Slit. Placement of Slit at the lumen surface depends on Cdc42 and formin function. Thus, Cdc42 and formins play pivotal roles in heart lumen formation through the spatiotemporal regulation of the actomyosin network."
1072,"Polo-like kinase 3 regulates CtIP during DNA double-strand break repair in G1."
1073,"DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) are repaired by nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ) or homologous recombination (HR). The C terminal binding protein-interacting protein (CtIP) is phosphorylated in G2 by cyclin-dependent kinases to initiate resection and promote HR. CtIP also exerts functions during NHEJ, although the mechanism phosphorylating CtIP in G1 is unknown. In this paper, we identify Plk3 (Polo-like kinase 3) as a novel DSB response factor that phosphorylates CtIP in G1 in a damage-inducible manner and impacts on various cellular processes in G1. First, Plk3 and CtIP enhance the formation of ionizing radiation-induced translocations; second, they promote large-scale genomic deletions from restriction enzyme-induced DSBs; third, they are required for resection and repair of complex DSBs; and finally, they regulate alternative NHEJ processes in Ku(-/-) mutants. We show that mutating CtIP at S327 or T847 to nonphosphorylatable alanine phenocopies Plk3 or CtIP loss. Plk3 binds to CtIP phosphorylated at S327 via its Polo box domains, which is necessary for robust damage-induced CtIP phosphorylation at S327 and subsequent CtIP phosphorylation at T847."

1076,"Candida nivariensis in comparison to different phenotypes of Candida glabrata."
1077,"The purpose of the study was to establish the prevalence of new Candida glabrata complex species: Candida nivariensis and Candida bracarensis isolated from clinical material, evaluate their phenotypes and the prevalence of gene family encoding extracellular glycosylphosphatidylinositol-linked aspartyl proteases, crucial for C. glabrata virulence. Study material included 224 C. glabrata clinical strains. Candida glabrata phenotypes were identified using CHROMagar Candida medium. Strains were analysed by using C. glabrata-specific PCR for the internal transcribed spacer region to confirmed the identification. To identify C. nivariensis and C. bracarensis strains, the D1/D2 region of 26S rRNA was sequenced. The prevalence of YPS-family proteases genes was detected using standard PCR method. Candida nivariensis amounted about 6% among the total number of C. glabrata strains. Candida nivariensis strains had a white phenotype on chromogenic agar media and assimilated two sugars - trehalose and glucose. Among the 13 C. nivariensis strains, 10 did not present any YPS-family protease genes. Coexistence of all detected YPS-family protease genes was specific for C. glabrata species. This study identified C. nivariensis strains; however, no C. bracarensis strains were identified. The white phenotype of C. nivariensis was confirmed. Most strains of the new species do not present any of the tested YPS genes."
1078,"Biomechanical comparison of mono-segment transpedicular fixation with short-segment fixation for treatment of thoracolumbar fractures: A finite element analysis."
1079,"Mono-segment transpedicular fixation is a method for the treatment of certain types of thoracolumbar spinal fracture. Finite element models were constructed to evaluate the biomechanics of mono-segment transpedicular fixation of thoracolumbar fracture. Spinal motion (T10-L2) was scanned and used to establish the models. The superior half of the cortical bone of T12 was removed and the superior half of the cancellous bone of the T12 body was assigned the material properties of injured bone to mimic vertebral fracture. Transpedicular fixation of T11 and T12 was performed to produce a mono-segment fixation model; T11 and L1 were fixed to produce a short-segment fixation model. Motion differences between functional units and von Mises stress on the spine and implants were measured under axial compression, anterior bending, extensional bending, lateral bending and axial rotation. We found no significant difference between mono- and short-segment fixations in the motion of any functional unit. Stress on the T10/T11 nucleus pulposus and T10/T11 and L1/L2 annulus fibrosus increased significantly by about 75% on anterior bending, extensional bending and lateral bending. In the fracture model, stress was increased by 24% at the inferior endplate of T10 and by 43% at the superior endplate of L2. All increased stresses were reduced after fixation and lower stress was observed with mono-segment fixation. In summary, the biomechanics of mono-segment pedicle screw instrumentation was similar to that of conventional short-segment fixation. As a minimally invasive treatment, mono-segment fixation would be appropriate for the treatment of selected thoracolumbar spinal fractures."
1080,"The outpatient management and special considerations of nausea and vomiting in pregnancy."
1081,"With 50-90% of pregnant women experiencing nausea and vomiting of pregnancy (NVP), the burden of illness can become quite significant if symptoms are under-treated and/or under-diagnosed, thus allowing for progression of the disease. The majority of these women will necessitate at least one visit with a provider to specifically address NVP, and up to 10% or greater will require pharmacotherapy after failure of conservative measures to adequately control symptoms. As a result, initiation of prompt and effective treatment in the outpatient setting is ideal. Once NVP is diagnosed and treatment is started, it is crucial to track symptoms in order to assess for a decrease in or resolution of symptoms as well as an escalation in symptoms requiring additional therapy. Of note, co-existing gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), Helicobacter pylori infection, and psychosocial factors may have a negative impact on the management of NVP. Ultimately, every woman has her own perception of disease severity and desire for treatment. It is critical that both the provider and patient be proactive in the diagnosis and management of NVP."
1082,"The enigma of low bilirubin kernicterus in premature infants: Why does it still occur, and is it preventable?"
1083,"Low bilirubin kernicterus in preterm neonates, though rare, remains an unpredictable and refractory form of brain injury. Hypoalbuminemia, co-morbid CNS insult(s), infection, and inflammation are contributing causes that, in many cases, appear to interact in potentiating bilirubin neurotoxicity. Despite compulsive attention to serum bilirubin levels, and clinical and laboratory indices of neurotoxicity risk, low bilirubin kernicterus continues to be seen in contemporary NICUs. While efforts to refine and improve current treatment guidelines are certainly needed, such revision(s) will also have to take into account the risks and benefits of any intervention, including phototherapy."

1085,"Infants with chronic bilirubin encephalopathy often demonstrate abnormal bilateral, symmetric, high-signal intensity on T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging of the globus pallidus and subthalamic nucleus, consistent with the neuropathology of kernicterus. Early magnetic resonance imaging of at-risk infants, while frequently showing increased T1-signal in these regions, may give false-positive findings due to the presence of myelin in these structures. Advanced magnetic resonance imaging including diffusion-weighted imaging, magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and diffusion tensor imaging with tractography may shed new insights into the pathogenesis of bilirubin-induced brain injury and the neural basis of long-term disability in infants and children with chronic bilirubin encephalopathy."
1086,"Congenital Malformations in the Newborn Population: A Population Study and Analysis of the Effect of Gender and Prematurity."
1087,"BACKGROUND: Congenital malformation (CM) is a leading cause of infant mortality. We hypothesized that the current estimates of the prevalence of CM are obsolete because of the increased rate of terminating fetuses with severe CMs and the widespread use of prenatal vitamins. METHODS: This population-based cross-sectional study analyzed the effect of sex and prematurity on CM prevalence. All data were derived from birth entries in the 2008 Nationwide Inpatient Sample (NIS) database. Our objectives were to determine the prevalence of CM diagnoses among all birth hospitalizations in 2008 and to analyze the effect of sex and gestational maturity on CM prevalence. RESULTS: We identified 29,312 patients with CMs from among 1,014,261 live births, which yielded a CM prevalence of 28.9 per 1000 live births. Associated genetic syndromes were present in 1172 (4%) patients. Among newborns with nonsyndromic CM, 91% of newborns had an isolated CM and 9% of newborns had multiple CMs. The cardiovascular system was the most commonly involved organ system. The risk of CM was significantly higher in preterm newborns for an isolated CM [odds ratio (OR), 1.5; confidence interval (CI), 1.4-1.5]; multiple CMs (OR, 2.1; CI, 2.0-2.3); and overall CMs (OR, 1.4; CI, 1.3-1.5). Males had higher risk of isolated CMs (OR, 1.3; CI, 1.2-1.5). However, there was no sex difference in the risk of overall CM. CONCLUSION: We reported up-to-date national estimates of the prevalence of CM, which is important for monitoring trends, determining service planning, and assessing disease burden because of congenital malformations in the United States of America. We also showed a strong association between CM and prematurity. Further study of this association is needed to provide insight into the etiology of these relatively common public health problems."
1088,"Modern Trunnions Are More Flexible: A Mechanical Analysis of THA Taper Designs."
1089,"BACKGROUND: There is renewed concern surrounding the potential for corrosion at the modular head-neck junction to cause early failure in contemporary THAs. Although taper corrosion involves a complex interplay of many factors, a previous study suggested that a decrease in flexural rigidity of the femoral trunnion may be associated with an increased likelihood of corrosion at retrieval. QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: By analyzing a large revision retrieval database of femoral stems released during a span of three decades, we asked: (1) how much does flexural rigidity vary among different taper designs; (2) what is the contribution of taper geometry alone to flexural rigidity of the femoral trunnion; and (3) how have flexural rigidity and taper length changed with time in this group of revised retrievals? METHODS: A dual-center retrieval analysis of 85 modular femoral stems released between 1983 and 2012 was performed, and the flexural rigidity and length of the femoral trunnions were determined. These stems were implanted between 1991 and 2012 and retrieved at revision or removal surgery between 2004 and 2012. There were 10 different taper designs made from five different metal alloys from 16 manufacturers. Digital calipers were used to measure taper geometries by two independent observers. RESULTS: Median flexural rigidity was 228 N-m2; however, there was a wide range of values among the various stems spanning nearly an order of magnitude between the most flexible (80 N-m2) and most rigid (623 N-m2) trunnions, which was partly attributable to the taper geometry and to the material properties of the base alloy. There was a negative correlation between flexural rigidity and length of the trunnion and release date of the stem. CONCLUSIONS: There is wide variability in flexural rigidity of various taper designs, with a trend toward trunnions becoming shorter and less rigid with time. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: This temporal trend may partly explain why taper corrosion is being seen with increasing frequency in modern THAs."
1090,"Do Laterally Wedged Insoles or Valgus Braces Unload the Medial Compartment of the Knee in Patients With Osteoarthritis?"
1091,"BACKGROUND: The results of conservative treatment of knee osteoarthritis (OA) are generally evaluated in epidemiological studies with clinical outcome measures as primary outcomes. Biomechanical evaluation of orthoses shows that there are potentially beneficial biomechanical changes to joint loading; however, evaluation in relation to clinical outcome measures in longitudinal studies is needed. QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: We asked (1) is there an immediate effect on gait in patients using a laterally wedged insole or valgus knee brace; (2) is there a late (6 weeks) effect; and (3) is there a difference between subgroups within each group with respect to patient compliance, body mass index, and OA status? METHODS: This was a secondary analysis of data from a previous randomized controlled trial of patients with early medial knee OA. A total of 91 patients were enrolled in that trial, and 73 (80%) completed it after 6 months. Of the enrolled patients, 80 (88%) met prespecified inclusion criteria for analysis in the present study. The patients were randomized to an insole or brace. Gait was analyzed with and without wearing the orthosis (insole or brace) at baseline and after 6 weeks. Measurements were taken of the knee adduction moment, ground reaction force, moment arm, walking speed, and toe-out angle. Data were analyzed with regression analyses based on an intention-to-treat principle. RESULTS: A mean reduction of 4% (+/- 10) (95% confidence interval [CI], -0.147 to -0.03, p = 0.003) of the peak knee adduction moment and 4% (+/- 13) (95% CI, -0.009 to -0.001, p = 0.01) of the moment arm at baseline was observed in the insole group when walking with an insole was compared with walking without an insole. A mean reduction of 1% (+/- 10) (95% CI, -0.002 to -0.001, p = 0.001) of the peak knee adduction moment and no reduction of the moment arm were measured after 6 weeks. No reduction of knee adduction moment, moment arm, or ground reaction force was seen in the brace group at baseline and after 6 weeks. Subgroup analysis showed no differences in biomechanical effect for obesity, stage of OA, and whether patients showed a clinical response to the treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Laterally wedged insoles unload the medial compartment only at baseline in patients with varus alignment and by an amount that might not be clinically important. No biomechanical alteration was seen after 6 weeks of wearing the insole. Valgus brace therapy did not result in any biomechanical alteration. Taken together, this study does not show a clinically relevant biomechanical effect of insole and brace therapy in patients with varus medial knee OA. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level I, therapeutic study. See Instructions for Authors for a complete description of levels of evidence."
1092,"A20 controls intestinal homeostasis through cell-specific activities."
1093,"The transcription factor NF-kappaB is indispensable for intestinal immune homeostasis, but contributes to chronic inflammation and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). A20, an inhibitor of both NF-kappaB and apoptotic signalling, was identified as a susceptibility gene for multiple inflammatory diseases, including IBD. Despite absence of spontaneous intestinal inflammation in intestinal epithelial cell (IEC) specific A20 knockout mice, we found additional myeloid-specific A20 deletion to synergistically drive intestinal pathology through cell-specific mechanisms. A20 ensures intestinal barrier stability by preventing cytokine-induced IEC apoptosis, while A20 prevents excessive cytokine production in myeloid cells. Combining IEC and myeloid A20 deletion induces ileitis and severe colitis, characterized by IEC apoptosis, Paneth and goblet cell loss, epithelial hyperproliferation and intestinal microbiota dysbiosis. Continuous epithelial cell death and regeneration in an inflammatory environment sensitizes cells for neoplastic transformation and the development of colorectal tumours in aged mice."
1094,"Combined C4d and CD3 immunostaining predicts IgA nephropathy progression."
1095,"A number of molecules have recently been shown to be involved in the pathogenesis and progression of IgA nephropathy (IgAN). Among these, we have selected C4d (complement lectin pathway involvement), CD3 (T-cell marker, traducing interstitial inflammation), Transglutaminase 2 (TGase-2, involved in tissue fibrosis development), and p-ERK 1/2 (protein kinase intracellular signaling molecule) to perform a panel of immunohistological biomarkers, and assess its predictive value for disease progression Immunohistochemical staining of these biomarkers was performed in paraffin sections from 74 renal biopsy cases with the clinical diagnosis of IgAN. Association between score analysis of these parameters and disease course was assessed through univariate and multivariate analysis, including baseline clinical and histological data. Univariate analysis showed that glomerular C4d, tubulointerstitial TGase2 and CD3 scores were associated with baseline proteinuria and disease progression. Multivariate analysis showed that only baseline estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), C4d and CD3 were independently associated with progressive kidney disease (decline of at least 50% in the eGFR or progression to ESRD during the follow-up period). Establishing an accurate prediction model for IgAN progression is still a matter of research in clinical nephrology. The complement system, particularly lectin pathway activation, and T cell activation, have previously been shown to be potential modifiers of the disease course. Here we show that the combination of two histological biomarkers (C4d and CD3) can be a powerful predictor of IgAN progression and a potential useful tool for the clinical approach of this disease."
1096,"The future of oats in the food and health continuum."
1097,"A large body of clinical evidence suggests that the consumption of 3 g or more per d of beta-glucan from oats or barley, as part of a diet low in saturated fat and cholesterol, may reduce the risk of CHD. The unique chemical and physical properties of oats and physiological responses to oat consumption contribute to their demonstrated health benefits; other health attributes are still under evaluation. Many of these benefits, such as those associated with a reduced risk of CVD, are codified in health claims by several regulatory agencies, such as the Food and Drug Administration in the USA and the European Food Safety Authority in Europe. Despite these oat-health relationships, an apparent decline in agricultural production, the presence of an array of plant pathogens, and dynamics of climatic conditions may preclude the availability and subsequent consumption of this commodity worldwide. Therefore, it is incumbent on scientists from multiple disciplines to advance research in a spectrum of arenas, including physico-chemical properties of oats, the impact of oats on an array of non-communicable diseases and human microbiome, agricultural practices and environments, and processing technologies that contribute to global food policies."

1107,"Presented herein are remote results of surgical treatment of 101 patients with atherosclerotic occlusion of the femoral-popliteal-tibial segment in the stage of critical ischaemia. The choice of the reconstructive operation was made based on the developed criteria. Femoral-popliteal shunting into the isolated segment of the reversed great saphenous vein was performed in 48 (47.52%) patients, and 53 (52.48%) patients underwent distal femoraltibial bypass grafting according to the in situ technique. The five-year patency of the graft in these groups was identical, amounting to 54.17 and 58.49%, respectively. In order to predict the duration of bypass graft patency in the isolated segment of the popliteal artery we worked out criteria of competence of the collateral blood flow. We also defined more exactly the indications for applying a relieving arteriovenous fistula in distal femorotibial shunting. When deciding upon a method of operative treatment, preference is given to shunting into the isolated popliteal artery in sufficient collateral blood flow."

Depending on the method of formation of the distal anastomosis the patients were subdivided into two groups: Group I with endarterectomy in the zone of the distal anastomosis, including 39 patients, and Group II without endarterectomy, comprising 93 patients. As the plastic material for bypass grafting we used autoveins in the ""reverse"" and ""in situ"" positions, allografts made of polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) or woven fabric, combined grafts. In the both groups prevailing were patients with critical ischaemia of the lower limbs. Thus, 20 (51.3%) patients had degree III ischaemia in Group One and 60 (64.5%) patients in Group Two, and 18 (46.2%) patients had ischaemia degree IV and 20 (21.5%), respectively. In order to evaluate the state of the distal bed we calculated the average score according to the Rutherford classification (Rutherford, et al., 1997), which amounted to 7.56 +/-1.5 and 6.2+/-1.43 for Group I and II, respectively. The best patency and limb salvage rate were observed in autovenous bypass grafting according to the ""in situ"" technique without endarterectomy. Thus, the cumulative patency amounted to 21% and limb salvage to 29.4% after 5 years."
1110,"[Pathological deformities of carotid arteries: aetiology, pathogenesis, clinical and pathomorphological alterations.]"
1111,"The study was aimed at examining cases of pathological deformities of carotid arteries (PD CA) as one of important causes of extracranial impairments of cerebral circulation. We examined a total of 254 biopsy samples obtained after surgical interventions. PD CA was combined with other diseases: almost in half of cases (47.2%) with atherosclerosis, in nearly one third of cases (27.9%) with atherosclerosis and fibromuscular dysplasia, with fibromuscular dysplasia in 14.5% of cases. PDs with no concomitant pathology were rare events encountered in only 26 (10.2%) patients. There were 158 (62.2%) women and 96 (37.8%) men. The patients' age varied from 18 to 79 years. It was proved that young adults develop PD without pre-existing vascular diseases, with its characteristic type being coiling. PDs in patients over 40 years old develop in consequence of atherosclerosis, fibromuscular dysplasia, exposure to toxic substances, with a characteristic type of PD being coiling. The pathomorphological examination of CA demonstrated intimal hyperplasia with smooth muscle cell proliferation, irreversible alterations of the medial elastic fibres with proliferation of fibrous connective tissue and dystrophy of collagen fibres and smooth muscle cells, as well as perivascular sclerosis without cellular infiltration in the adventitia. More accurate determination of the aetiology and pathogenesis of PD CA requires further pathomorphological studies aimed at specifying morphogenesis characteristic of each type of PD."
1112,"[Assessment of efficacy of reconstructive operations on carotid arteries in combination of stenosis and pathological tortuosity.]"
1113,"OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to assess efficacy of reconstructive operations on carotid arteries in patients presenting with stenosis of the internal carotid artery (ICA) combined with its pathological tortuosity. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We analysed our experience in surgical treatment of 84 patients with pathological tortuosity of the ICA combined with atherosclerotic stenosis. The study included patients with ICA stenosis >/=60% (any type of the atherosclerotic plaque) and with any degree of cerebrovascular insufficiency (CVI), or with ICA stenosis <60% (type I-III atherosclerotic plaque) with degree II-IV CVI in a combination with either S- or C-shaped tortuosity of the ICA, kinking or coiling, with the linear blood flow rate >/=110 cm/s and turbulence of blood flow. Only six (7.1%) patients of the 84 (100%) presented with no clinical signs of CVI and were found to have a past medical history free from episodes of cerebral circulation impairments. The ratio of asymptomatic/symptomatic patients was as follows: in group 1 - 12 (58.7%)/19 (61.3%), in group 2 - 27 (81.8%)/6 (18.2%), and in group 3 - 10 (50%)/10 (50%). RESULTS: Six months after surgery, the asymptomatic/symptomatic patients ratio was as follows: in group 1 - 22 (70.9%)/9 (29.1%), in group 2 - 28 (84.8%)/5 (15.2%), p=0.045, and in group 3 - 9 (45%)/11 (55%), p=0.024. In group 3, one (5%) patient developed thrombosis of the reconstruction zone with the development of ischaemic-type acute cerebral circulation impairment. Twelve months after surgery the ratio in the groups did not change. Of twelve patients with degree IV chronic CVI, four (33.3%) were found to have partial regression of the focal neurological symptomatology. CONCLUSION: Surgical method of treatment of patients with ICA stenos combined with pathological tortuosity proved efficient and safe both for asymptomatic patients and patients with clinical manifestations of CVI. Significantly better results were observed in the group subjected to eversion carotid endarterectomy with resection of the excessive ICA, with brining down and reimplantation into the ostium as compared with carotid endarterectomy with a patch and as compared with ICA resection with prosthetic repair."
1114,"[Experience with six-month administration of red vine leaf extract in hormone-induced phlebopathy.]"
1115,"OBJECTIVE: The study was aimed at assessing efficacy and tolerability of six-month administration of a red vine leaf extract (Antistax(R) - 360 mg/day) in women presenting with orthostasis-dependent phlebopathy of the lower limbs on the background of long-term hormone replacement therapy. Of the 62 women included into the study, 59 completed it. Treatment with Antistax(R) was accompanied and followed by a distinct decrease in the circumference of the calf as early as during the first 3 months from 36.77+/-2.892 cm to 35.98+/-2.831 cm (p=0.001), which remained stable for the subsequent 3 months despite taking hormonal agents. A decrease in the ankle circumference was similar, but less demonstrative. The evening diameter of the great saphenous vein (GSV) also decreased from 0.70+/-0.11 to 0.65+/-0.099 (p=0.001) and did not increase within the subsequent 3 months. There was a subjectively perceived decrease in the intensity of the venous symptoms along the 10-cm visual analogue scale (VAS), being also more pronounced during the first 3 months. Quality of life according to the CIVIQ2 questionnaire, in spite of continuing hormone therapy, improved from 42.03+/-7.634 to 30.36+/-8.646 (p=0.000001). Administration of Antistax(R) was well tolerated. Mild undesirable events were observed in 3 (5.08%) women and disappeared spontaneously. Patient compliance amounted to 99%. CONCLUSION: Antistax(R) (360 mg/day) orally administered in women suffering from orthostasis-dependent phlebopathy and taking hormonal replacement therapy is safe during 6 months, leading to a decrease in the measurements of the lower extremities and veins diameter, relieving venous symptoms, occurring to a greater extent within the first 3 months, and exerting a stable maintaining effect during the subsequent 3 months, and hence may be used in cases of prolonged replacement therapy."
1116,"[Optimization of anticoagulation therapy for venous thromboembolism.]"
1117,"OBJECTIVE: To optimize anticoagulation therapy for venous thromboembolism by means of dabigatran etexilate. MATERIAL AND METHODS: From 2006 to 2012, within the framework of the international trials RE-COVER and RE-COVER II aimed at evaluating efficacy and safety of dabigatran etexilate compared to warfarin, a total of 95 patients meeting the inclusion and exclusion criteria were enrolled in our study. As part of the RE-COVER trial, we carried out analysis of comprehensive examination and treatment of 55 patients with venous thromboembolism (VTE), who were randomly divided into two groups. Group I (Control Group) consisted of 30 patients receiving initial therapy with heparin for seven days followed by taking warfarin for six months. Group II (Study Group) comprised 25 patients taking dabigatran etexilate instead of warfarin. RESULTS: There were no cases of recurrent VTE in the Control Group, and one (4%) patient of the Study Group was found to have a relapse of the disease owing to resistance to anticoagulation therapy and congenital thrombophilia. Undesirable events of anticoagulation therapy developed in 20% of the Control Group patients an in 16% of the Study Group patients. In two Control Group patients and one Study Group patient anticoagulation therapy was discontinued due to the development of complications. After 2 years, 36.7% of the Control Group patients and 40% of the Study Group patients had no manifestations of chronic venous insufficiency (CVI). The degree of CVI was similar in the both groups. CONCLUSION: Dabigatran proved non-inferior to warfarin regarding efficacy, possessing, however, a series of advantages: it has a predictable anticoagulant effect, requires neither monitoring of the haemostasis system, nor dose adjustment, and is administered at standard dosages."
1118,"[The place of novel oral anticoagulants in prevention and treatment of venous thromboembolism.]"
1119,"The notion ""venous thromboembolism"" combines two processes: thrombosis of deep veins and pulmonary artery thromboembolism. The necessity in long-term adequate anticoagulant therapy as the basic treatment of patients with deep vain thrombosis does not give rise to doubts, it should be started prior to instrumental verification of the diagnosis. The past decade was marked by the appearance on the pharmaceutical market of a new oral anticoagulant: selective blocker of the Xa factor of blood coagulation system - rivaroxaban. According to the data of large-scale randomized clinical trials, the efficacy and safety of rivaroxaban are comparable to those of traditional conventional anticoagulant therapy (non-fractionated/low-molecular-weight heparin NFH/LMW + warfarin). Indisputable advantages of new agents are as follows: the lack of the necessity in laboratory monitoring, no interaction with foodstuff, minimal interaction with other drugs, minimal risk for the development of haemorrhage, and simplicity of dosing."
1120,"[First experience with ""SUPERA Veritas"" stent in treatment of patients with occlusive and stenotic lesions of the femoropopliteal arterial segment.]"
1121,"Surgical interventions are used more often for treatment of patients with lesions of arteries of the femoropopliteal segment. Considerable role in widening indications for using an endovascular method of treatment is played by improvement of roentgenosurgical tools and equipment. Implantation of stents into arteries of this segment has become a standard intervention whose results are the starting point for comparing with the results of other methods of roentgenendovascular revascularization. The SUPERA Veritas system is the first nitinol interwoven stent that is fracture-resistant due to special manufacturing technology. The results of multicenter randomized studies are suggestive of its good clinical effect in restoration of the lumen of arteries of the femoral-popliteal segment. According to the findings of European and American researchers, the stent's primary patency lies within the range from 79.2 to 87.7% which is comparable to primary patency of nitinol stents with antiproliferative drug coating. The authors share the first experience with this stent in Russia, reflecting peculiarities of its implantation, as well as describing clinical case reports of using this stent in arteries of the femoropopliteal segment in patients with atherosclerosis of lower limb arteries and diabetes mellitus, also providing the data on stent's patency one year after implantation according to the findings of noninvasive studies."

1123,"The study was aimed at assessing remote results of endovascular treatment of patients presenting with lower limb critical ischaemia (LLCI) and kept on chronic haemodialysis. We retrospectively analysed the results of endovascular interventions in a total of 16 patients with ischaemic defects of the foot being on chronic haemodialysis, performed from 2001 to 2012 at the Department of Roentgenosurgical Methods of Diagnosis and Treatment of the St. Petersburg Scientific Research Institute for Emergency Ambulance Care named after I.I. Dzhanelidze. The patients' age varied from 39 to 75 years (mean 56.2+/-12.8 years). There were 11 (68.7%) men and 5 (31.3%) women. Ten patients (62.5%) suffered from diabetes mellitus. Of the ten diabetic patients, nine (56.2%) received insulin. A total of 21 endovascular interventions were performed on 16 extremities. The obtained findings were statistically processed by means of the Kaplan-Meier method. During follow up, LLCI relapses were observed in eleven (68.7%) patients, amputation of the femur was performed in eight (50%) patients, and five (31.2%) patients survived without major amputation. One year and two years after intervention, the probability of LLCI relapse absence amounted to 37.5 and 30%, respectively, that of major amputation - to 67.5 and 24.1%, survival without major amputation - to 50 and 17.9%, respectively. Patients with LLCI kept on chronic haemodialysis belong to a group of high risk of limb loss and a lethal outcome within 2 years after angioplasty."
1124,"[Additional methods of diagnosis of unstable atherosclerotic plaques in carotid arteries.]"
1125,"The method of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was used to study the concentration of interleukins (OL)-6, 10, C-reactive protein (CRP) in blood serum of 61 patients presenting with atherosclerotic lesions of carotid arteries (CA). The obtained findings were compared with the morphological peculiarities of the biopsy materials of the atherosclerotic plaques (ASP) obtained while carrying out carotid endarterectomy (CEA). An increased concentration of IL-6 and CRP in blood serum of patients with unstable ASPs was revealed. It was shown that measuring cytokines and CRP in blood serum may be used as an additional method for diagnosis of unstable nature of ASP in the CAs in order to determine the indications for carotid endarterectomy."

1127,"OBJECTIVE: preliminary assessment of efficacy and safety of prolonged anticoagulant therapy with Rivaroxaban in patients after implantation of a cava filter. MATERIAL AND METHODS: this prospective clinical study included a total of 30 patients presenting with thrombosis of deep veins of lower limbs of proximal localization with signs of flotation of the thrombus and free apex more than 4 cm in length. The patients received a temporal cava filter later on not removed for various reasons. After implantation of the cava filter the patients were given therapeutic doses of low molecular weight heparins during 48 hours followed by switching to standard therapy with vitamin K antagonists or to an alternative regimen of treatment with new anticoagulant Rivaroxaban (15 mg twice daily for the first three weeks, then 20 mg once daily during the whole period of follow up). Rivaroxaban (Study Group) was given to 15 patients (8 men and 7 women aged from 35 to 87 years, mean age 65.5+/-16.2) having from one to six (averagely 2.9+/-1.4) individual risk factors for the development of venous thrombosis. Each of them had a matching patient included in the control group, receiving conventional therapy with vitamin K antagonists and corresponding by age (+/- 5 years), gender, and the total number of individual risk factors (+/- 1). The maximal duration of follow up amounted to 1 year. RESULTS: the cava filter according to the findings of ultrasound duplex scanning was patent during the whole follow-up period in 100% of patients in the both groups. No relapses of venous thromboembolic complications were registered in any patient. The cumulative frequency of the development of haemorrhagic complications amounted to 13% for the Study Group patients and to 20% for the Controls, with the differences being statistically significant. In the control group haemorrhagic complications were of more severe forms: one intracranial haemorrhage and two intracutaneous haemorrhages (in the Study group - one intracutaneous haemorrhage and one gingival haemorrhage). CONCLUSION: the study showed possibilities and safely of using new oral anticoagulant Rivaroxaban in patients with the implanted cava filter. The obtained pilot findings require further confirmation in randomized clinical studies."

1134,"Performance and limitations of steatosis biomarkers in patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease."
1135,"BACKGROUND: Several steatosis biomarkers are available with limited independent validation. AIM: To determine diagnostic value and limitations of several steatosis biomarkers using liver biopsy as reference standard in a large cohort of patients with suspected NAFLD. METHODS: Three hundred and twenty-four consecutive liver biopsies were included. Histological steatosis was categorised as none (<5%), mild (5-33%), moderate (33-66%) and severe (>66%). Five steatosis biomarkers were measured: fatty liver index (FLI), NAFLD liver fat score (NAFLD-LFS), hepatic steatosis index (HSI), visceral adiposity index (VAI) and triglyceride x glucose (TyG) index. RESULTS: Steatosis grades prevalence was: none 5%, mild 39%, moderate 30% and severe 27%. Except for VAI, the steatosis biomarkers showed a linear trend across the steatosis grades. However, their correlation with the histological amount of steatosis was only weak-moderate. All steatosis biomarkers had an adequate diagnostic accuracy for the presence of steatosis: AUROCs for FLI, LFS, HSI, VAI and TyG were 0.83, 0.80, 0.81, 0.92 and 0.90. However, their ability to quantify steatosis was poor: none of them distinguished between moderate and severe steatosis and the AUROCs for predicting steatosis >33% were 0.65, 0.72, 0.65, 0.59 and 0.59 for FLI, LFS, HSI, VAI and TyG. Both fibrosis and inflammation significantly confounded the association between steatosis biomarkers and steatosis. The steatosis biomarkers were all correlated with HOMA-IR, independent from histological steatosis. CONCLUSIONS: All five steatosis biomarkers can diagnose steatosis and are correlated with insulin resistance. They are confounded by fibrosis and inflammation, and do not accurately quantify steatosis; this may limit their clinical utility. More research is needed to identify truly independent and quantitative markers of steatosis."
1136,"TRAF6 upregulation in spinal astrocytes maintains neuropathic pain by integrating TNF-alpha and IL-1beta signaling."
1137,"The proinflammatory cytokines TNF- and IL-1 have been strongly implicated in the pathogenesis of neuropathic pain, but the intracellular signaling of these cytokines in glial cells are not fully understood. Tumor necrosis factor receptor associated factor 6 (TRAF6) plays a key role in signal transduction in the TNF receptor superfamily and the interleukin-1 receptor superfamily. In this study, we investigated the role of TRAF6 in neuropathic pain in mice following spinal nerve ligation (SNL). SNL induced persistent TRAF6 upregulation in the spinal cord. Interestingly, TRAF6 was mainly colocalized with the astrocytic marker GFAP on SNL day 10 and partially expressed in microglia on SNL day 3. In cultured astrocytes, TRAF6 was up-regulated after exposure to TNF-alpha or IL-1beta. TNF-alpha or IL-1beta also increased CCL2 expression, which was suppressed by both siRNA and shRNA targeting TRAF6. TRAF6 siRNA treatment also inhibited the phosphorylation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) in astrocytes induced by TNF-alpha or IL-1beta. JNK inhibitor D-NKI-1 dose-dependently decreased IL-1-induced CCL2 expression. Moreover, spinal injection of TRAF6 siRNA decreased intrathecal TNF-- or IL-1-induced allodynia and hyperalgesia. Spinal TRAF6 inhibition via TRAF6 siRNA, shRNA lentivirus, or antisense oligodeoxynucleotides partially reversed SNL-induced neuropathic pain and spinal CCL2 expression. Finally, intrathecal injection of TNF-alpha-activated astrocytes induced mechanical allodynia, which was attenuated by pretreatment of astrocytes with TRAF6 siRNA. Taken together, the results suggest that TRAF6, upregulated in spinal cord astrocytes in the late phase after nerve injury, maintains neuropathic pain by integrating TNF- and IL-1 signaling and activating the JNK/CCL2 pathway in astrocytes."
1138,"Placebo use in pain management: the role of medical context, treatment efficacy, and deception in determining placebo acceptability."
1139,"Placebo effects can act as powerful pain relievers. While the ethics of therapeutic placebo use is highly controversial, recent evidence suggests that medical providers frequently utilize placebo treatments, and patients may be open to these interventions under certain contexts. This investigation used a patient-centered approach to answer essential questions about placebo treatment acceptability. People with chronic musculoskeletal pain completed a placebo survey where they: 1) rated their knowledge of placebo and its efficacy for alleviating pain; 2) evaluated the acceptability of a placebo analgesic interventions across several unique medical contexts; and 3) responded to six different patient-physician treatment scenarios to assess the role of deception and placebo effectiveness on mood and provider trust. Results showed that participants had limited knowledge of placebo and it's efficacy for alleviating pain. Placebo acceptability was highly dependent on the context of the intervention, as placebo treatments were considered acceptable when used as complementary/adjunct treatments and when no other established treatments were available. Also, an analgesic placebo response mitigated the negative consequences of deception by improving provider trust and decreasing negative mood. These findings suggest that patients may be rather pragmatic in their appraisals of placebo treatment acceptability and may consider a variety of treatments/contexts as permissible for managing their pain. This is the first study of its kind to quantify perceptions of placebo analgesia knowledge and efficacy among individuals with chronic pain, and to assess the role of different medical contexts in treatment acceptability."
1140,"[Why is it necessary to review the December 15th 2003 circular relative to the transfusion act?]"
1141,"Blood transfusion is currently a delegated medical act in patient care services. Following severe adverse events, hemovigilance now disposes of a dense regulation. Data collection and analysis in the national hemovigilance ""e-FIT"" database allow detection of errors or malfunctions in the transfusion act. Blood transfusion safety depends on the strict respect of processes from the prescription of blood products and required patient immuno-hematology exams to the administration of blood products and follow-up of the patient. In the circular relative to the transfusion act, many steps of the transfusion process, less explicit, can be interpreted differently by health care professionals and thus lead to errors or severe adverse events. Standardization of procedures for the transfusion act and its surveillance would increase their safety and avoid potential risks for the patient."
1142,"[Relevance of safety measures to avoid HTLV transmission by transfusion in 2014.]"
1143,"In high-income countries, the safety of blood transfusion related to viruses has reached a very high level, especially thanks to the implementation of multiple measures aimed at reducing the transfusion risk. The cost-effectiveness of these preventive measures is frequently discussed due to global financial resources, which are more and more limited. Hence, the revision of safety strategies is a key issue, especially when these strategies are redundant, as those implemented to avoid Human T-cell Lymphotropic Virus (HTLV) transmission, which are based on both antibodies screening and leucoreduction of blood products. The residual risk of the transmission of HTLV by transfusion has been recently estimated at 1 in 20 million donations (2010-2012) in France (excluding overseas territories). This estimation did not take into account the leucoreduction, which appears to be a very efficient preventive measure as the virus is strictly intra-cellular. To help decision-making, we have evaluated some parameters related to HTLV blood transmission. Firstly, the probability that an incident occurring during the leucoreduction process affects a HTLV-positive blood donation has been estimated at 1 in 178 million. Estimation of clinical consequences of HTLV-positive transfusions would affect 1 to 2 transfused-patients without leucoreduction, and one recipient every 192 years in case of 10% failures of the filtration method. Obviously, despite a risk, which appears to be controlled, HTLV screening will be disputed as soon as the efficiency of leucoreduction to totally prevent virus blood transmission will be proven and when pathogen inactivation methods are generalized to all blood cellular products."
1144,"OVOL2 is a critical regulator of ER71 in generating FLK1+ cells, hematopoietic and endothelial cells from embryonic stem cells."
1145,"We here report that OVOL2, a C2H2 zinc finger protein, is a novel binding protein of ER71 which is a critical transcription factor for blood and vessel development. OVOL2 directly interacted with ER71, but not with ETS1 or ETS2, in the nucleus. ER71-mediated activation of the Flk1 promoter was further enhanced by OVOL2, although OVOL2 alone failed to activate it. Consistently, co-expression of ER71 and OVOL2 in differentiating embryonic stem cells (ESCs) led to a significant augmentation of FLK1+, endothelial and hematopoietic cells. Such cooperative effects were impaired by the shRNA-mediated inhibition of Ovol2. Collectively, we show that ER71 directly interacts with OVOL2 and that such interaction is critical for FLK1+ cell generation and their differentiation into downstream cell lineages."
1146,"FOXP1 directly represses transcription of pro-apoptotic genes and cooperates with NF-kappaB to promote survival of human B-cells."
1147,"The forkhead transcription factor FOXP1 is involved in B-cell development and function, and is generally regarded as an oncogene in activated B cell-like (ABC) subtype of diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma, lymphomas relying on constitutive NF-kappaB activity for survival. However, the mechanism underlying its putative oncogenic activity has not been established. By gene expression microarray, upon overexpression or silencing of FOXP1 in primary human B-cells and DLBCL cell-lines, combined with chromatin-immunoprecipitation followed by next-generation sequencing (ChIP-seq), we established that FOXP1 directly represses a set of 7 pro-apoptotic genes. Low expression of these genes, encoding the BH3-only proteins BIK and Harakiri, the p53-regulatory proteins TP63, RASSF6 and TP53INP1, AIM2 and EAF2, is associated with poor survival in DLBCL patients. In line with these findings, we demonstrated that FOXP1 promotes the expansion of primary mature human B-cells by inhibiting caspase-dependent apoptosis, without affecting B-cell proliferation. Furthermore, FOXP1 is dependent upon, and cooperates with, NF-kappaB signaling to promote B-cell expansion and survival. Taken together, our data indicate that, through direct repression of pro-apoptotic genes, (aberrant) expression of FOXP1 complements (constitutive) NF-kappaB activity to promote B-cell survival, and can thereby contribute to B-cell homeostasis and lymphomagenesis."

1149,"Rhabdoid tumors are a heterogeneous family of aggressive tumors affecting young children. Their grouping within a single entity is recent, following the discovery of a bi-allelic inactivation of the hSNF5/INI1 tumor suppressor gene in tumoral cells. This bi-allelic inactivation of the hSNF5/INI1 gene found at the constitutional level in up to one-third of cases has led to the identification of a predisposal syndrome to rhabdoid tumors. Herein we report extrarenal rhabdoid tumors observed in three infants between 3 and 6months of age, underlining the misleading feature of the clinical presentation and the aggressiveness of the disease. Finally, we also report the genetic patient care management strategy."
1150,"[Setting-up an epidemiological monitoring system of mortality by trauma in children under 15 years of age in metropolitan France.]"
1151,"In metropolitan France in 2009, trauma was the leading cause of death among children under 15 years of age: 459 deaths (source CepiDc), with 236 deaths by home and leisure injuries (HLI). These rough mortality data do not describe the circumstances of the trauma responsible for the death. The ""Fatal home and leisure injury among children under 15 years old-MAC-15"" feasibility study was set up in 2009 in France in the following regions: Ile-de-France, Nord-Pas-de-Calais, and Provence-Alpes-Cote d'Azur. The main objective of the survey was to understand exactly how these accidents occurred and determine their risk factors. Its secondary objectives were to test the feasibility and analyze the possibility of extending and/or scaling up the monitoring of these deaths. Case reporting was made through death certificates, contacts with regional health agencies, and media surveillance. A detailed record was completed by the medical certifier. In 2009, 76 HLI-related deaths in under 15-year-old children were identified by the survey in the three regions. The victims were mostly boys. The most common cause of death was drowning, followed by suffocation, falls, and fires. The survey contributed to precisely determining the risk factors of HLIs in children and, most often, to identifying the cause responsible for the fatal accident. The feasibility conclusions of this survey are positive, data collection is effective and practicable, and its quality and exhaustiveness were demonstrated. Implementation of the ""detailed analyses of the deaths by trauma among children under 15 years old"" survey is proposed. This survey will be extended to all deaths by trauma among children in Metropolitan France."
1152,"Variability of Criteria for Pasteurized Donor Human Milk Use: A Survey of U.S. Neonatal ICU Medical Directors."
1153,"Background: Use of donor human milk (DHM) is increasing, but criteria for its use are not well defined. Materials and Methods: We conducted a 34-question Internet-based survey of medical directors of U.S. level 3 and level 4 neonatal intensive care units (NICUs), with the goal of describing specifics of policies developed to guide DHM use in U.S. NICUs. Respondents reported NICU characteristics and details of policies concerning DHM use. Policy-specified criteria for DHM use, if any, were described. Bivariate and multivariate analyses were used to identify NICU characteristics associated with DHM use. Results: Respondents returned 153 (33%) surveys, with use of DHM reported by 91 (59%). Donor human milk use was more likely with more than 100 annual admissions <1500 g at birth (odds ratio [OR], 2.2; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.1-4.7) and with Vermont-Oxford Network participants (OR, 4.6; 95% CI, 1.8-11.6). Among 72 NICUs reporting a written policy, criteria for providing DHM required birth weights varying from <1000 to <1800 g and/or gestational ages from <28 to <34 completed weeks, but criteria were reportedly waived in many circumstances. Policies regarding duration of DHM therapy were similarly varied. Conclusions: Criteria for initiating and continuing DHM vary widely among U.S. level 3 and level 4 NICUs. Donor human milk use is more frequent in NICUs with many very low-birth-weight admissions and among Vermont-Oxford Network participants. Further research is needed to define short- and long-term outcomes and cost benefits of DHM use in subgroups of NICU patients, particularly for uses other than necrotizing enterocolitis prevention."
1154,"Prevalence of and risk factors for the occurrence of symptomatic osteoarthritis in rural regions of Shanxi Province, China."
1155,"AIM: To determine the prevalence of symptomatic osteoarthritis (OA) in rural regions of Shanxi Province, China, and to identify factors increasing the prevalence of OA. METHOD: Residents over 16 years of age of targeted towns and villages in rural regions of Shanxi Province were sampled using a stratified multi-stage cluster method. Those exhibiting symptoms of rheumatism were referred to rheumatologists and those in whom rheumatism was suspected were X-rayed within 10 days of interview. OA was diagnosed by consensus (two or three rheumatologists). Factors associated with the presence of OA were identified. RESULTS: A total of 7126 permanent residents were surveyed and 1734 (24.3%) had OA. Knee OA was the most prevalent form of OA (13.8%), followed by lumbar (7.4%), cervical (3.4%), hand (3.3%), shoulder (3.0%), elbow (2.9%), ankle (0.7%), hip (0.6%), wrist (0.5%), thoracic (0.5%) and foot OA (0.5%). All of knee, ankle, shoulder and hand OA exhibited a gender bias. Advanced age, a sweet tooth, poor home ventilation, poor home heating, separation, divorce, or death of a partner, low-grade occupation, low educational level, high body mass index and the presence of concomitant cardiovascular disease, were associated with the presence of OA. CONCLUSION: Symptomatic OA is very prevalent in rural regions of Shanxi Province. Many factors increase the prevalence of the condition. Primary and secondary prevention programs seeking to improve living conditions, to reduce obesity, and to effectively treat concomitant cardiovascular disease, are required."
1156,"Distinct and redundant roles of exonucleases in cryptococcusneoformans: Implications for virulence and mating."
1157,"Opportunistic pathogens like Cryptococcus neoformans are constantly exposed to changing environments, in their natural habitat as well as when encountering a human host. This requires a coordinated program to regulate gene expression that can act at the levels of mRNA synthesis and also mRNA degradation. Here, we find that deletion of the gene encoding the major cytoplasmic 5'-->3' exonuclease Xrn1p in C. neoformans has important consequences for virulence associated phenotypes such as growth at 37 degrees C, capsule and melanin. In an invertebrate model of cryptococcosis the alteration of these virulence properties corresponds to avirulence of the xrn1Delta mutant strains. Additionally, deletion of XRN1 impairs uni- and bisexual mating. On a molecular level, the absence of XRN1 is associated with the upregulation of other major exonuclease encoding genes (i.e. XRN2 and RRP44). Using inducible alleles of RRP44 and XRN2, we show that artificial overexpression of these genes alters LAC1 gene expression and mating. Our data thus suggest the existence of a complex interdependent regulation of exonuclease encoding genes that impact upon virulence and mating in C. neoformans."
1158,"Nationwide linkage analysis in Scotland-Has mortality following hospital admission for Crohn's disease changed in the early 21st century?"
1159,"BACKGROUND: National Scottish data were used to compare 3-year mortality in patients hospitalized for Crohn's disease (CD) between 1998-2000 and 2007-2009. METHODS: The linked Scottish Morbidity Records database was used to identify patients admitted with CD during two periods: Period 1 (1998-2000) and Period 2 (2007-2009). 3-year mortality and standardized mortality ratio (SMR) were determined and multivariable logistic regression analysis of associated factors was performed. Mortality was determined following four admission types: surgery-elective, surgery-emergency, medical-elective and medical-emergency. 3-year mortality was compared between study periods using age-standardized rates. RESULTS: The number of patients per 100,000 population hospitalized with CD per year was unchanged (15.7 [Period 1]; 14.4 [Period 2]). Overall crude and adjusted 3-year mortality rates were also unchanged (crude mortality 9.0%-9.1%, adjusted mortality odds ratio [OR]=0.87, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.65-1.17; p=0.36). The adjusted 3-year mortality increased following elective surgery (Period 1: 1/303 [0.3%]; Period 2: 9/261 [3.4%]); OR=13.5 [CI 1.66-109.99]) and decreased following emergency medical admission (Period 1: 99/779 [12.7%]; Period 2:86/802 [10.7%]; OR=0.68 [CI 0.47-0.97]). Directly age-standardized mortality rates were similar (Period 1:338/10,000 person years [CI 282-394]; Period 2:333/10,000 person years [CI 276-390], p=0.2). On multivariable regression, age, deprivation status, comorbidity and the length of hospital stay were associated with mortality in both periods. High 3-year mortality was observed during both periods in patients between 50 and 64years (Period 1: 33/298 [11.1%, SMR=4.8 [CI 3.44-6.63], Period 2: 33/296 [11.1%, SMR=5.9 [4.14-8.22]) and over 65years(Period 1: 94/275 [34.2%, SMR=2.78 [CI 2.42-3.62], Period 2: 78/251 [31.1%, SMR=3.31 [2.64-4.11]). CONCLUSION: Nationwide linkage data demonstrate that overall 3-year mortality after hospitalization for CD is high, especially in patients over 50years, and has not altered between the time periods 1998-2000 and 2007-2009."
1160,"Systematic review: Histological remission in inflammatory bowel disease. Is 'complete' remission the new treatment paradigm? An IOIBD initiative."
1161,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Advances in the medical management of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) have altered treatment targets. Endoscopic mucosal healing is associated with better outcomes in IBD, though less is known about the significance of achieving histological remission. Our aim was to perform a systematic review to investigate whether histological or 'complete' remission constitutes a further therapeutic target in IBD. METHODS: A bibliographic search was performed on the 1st of October 2013 and subsequently on the 1st of March 2014 of online databases (OVID SP MEDLINE, OVID EMBASE, National Pubmed Central Medline, Cochrane Library, ISI, conference abstracts), using MeSH terms and key words: (""inflammatory bowel diseases"" OR ""crohn disease"" OR ""ulcerative colitis"" OR ""colitis"") AND (""mucosal healing"" OR ""histological healing"" OR ""pathological healing"" OR ""histological scoring"" OR ""pathological scoring""). RESULTS: The search returned 2951 articles. 120 articles were cited in the final analysis. There is no validated definition of histological remission in IBD. There are 22 different histological scoring systems for IBD, none of which are fully validated. Microscopic inflammation persists in 16-100% of cases of endoscopically quiescent disease. There is evidence that histological remission may predict risk of complications in ulcerative colitis beyond endoscopic mucosal healing, though data are scarce in Crohn's disease. CONCLUSIONS: Histological remission in IBD represents a target distinct from endoscopic mucosal healing, not yet routinely sought in clinical trials or practice. There remains a need for a standardized and validated histological scoring system and to confirm the prognostic value of histological remission as a treatment target in IBD."
1162,"A population-based study of the resource utilization and costs of managing resectable non-small cell lung cancer."
1163,"OBJECTIVES: Surgical resection and adjuvant chemotherapy have become standard of care for treating resectable early stage non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The purpose was to describe and compare the overall and regional resource utilization and costs of resected NSCLC treated with and without adjuvant chemotherapy. MATERIALS & METHODS: A population-based retrospective cohort study of resected NSCLC patients, diagnosed between 2004 and 2006 (representing the cohort immediately affected by the change in clinical practice) was performed using administrative data. Patients were followed for four years from the date of surgery. The healthcare system perspective was used, and cost estimates (2012 US$) were derived from administrative data and the literature. RESULTS: 3354 patients were included. The average cost per patient treated with surgery and adjuvant chemotherapy was $37,860.88 and was significantly higher than the average cost per patient treated with surgery alone $32,221.45 (p<0.0001). Among regions, the costs of patients treated with surgery and chemotherapy ($32,672-$45,453) and the costs of those treated with surgery alone ($28,679-$36,845) varied significantly (p<0.0001). Rates of chemotherapy, the proportion of patients who received any imaging scans, hospitalizations, specialist visits, emergency room visits, mean number of imaging scans, general physician visits, and blood transfusions all varied significantly among geographic regions. CONCLUSIONS: This population-based study demonstrates an average cost per patient similar to that shown in randomized controlled trials; however, costs for either treatment approach varied by geographic region. Understanding the regional variation in costs and resource utilization is important with respect to delivering optimal treatment in a cost-effective strategy."
1164,"Metformin decreases lung cancer risk in diabetic patients in a dose-dependent manner."
1165,"OBJECTIVES: Higher risk of lung cancer has been noted in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM). Some observational studies have shown a reduced risk of lung cancer in DM patients taking metformin, but a dose-response relationship has never been reported. The aim of this study is to exam the association between the dose of metformin and the incidence of lung cancer in a Chinese population. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The dataset used for this nationwide population-based study is a cohort of 1 million subjects randomly sampled from individuals enrolled in the Taiwan National Health Insurance system. We enrolled all subjects with newly diagnosed type 2 DM between 1997 and 2007. Subjects with a diagnosis of neoplasm before DM diagnosis, those using metformin before DM diagnosis, those with polycystic ovary syndrome, and those with a DM diagnosis before their 15 years of age were excluded. The demographic data and duration, cumulative dose and intensity of metformin use were compared between patients developing lung cancer and those without lung cancer. RESULTS: Totally, 47,356 subjects were identified. After adjusting for age, gender, and modified Charlson Comorbidity Index score, the utilization of metformin was an independent protecting factor, and the risk of developing lung cancer decreased progressively with either the higher cumulative dose or the higher intensity of metformin use. CONCLUSIONS: This study revealed that the use of metformin decreased the risk of lung cancer in a dose-dependent manner in patients with type 2 DM. The chemo-preventive effect of metformin deserves further study."
1166,"Cumulative live birth rate after two single frozen embryo transfers (eSFET) versus a double frozen embryo transfer (DFET) with cleavage stage embryos: a retrospective cohort study."
1167,"PURPOSE: According to the latest ART report for Europe, about 13 % of pregnancies after frozen embryo transfer are multiple. Our objective was to analyse the impact on the multiple pregnancy rate of two eSFET (elective single frozen embryo transfers) versus a DFET (double frozen embryo transfer) in women aged under 38 years, who had not achieved pregnancy in their fresh transfer and who had at least two vitrified embryos of A/B quality. METHODS: This study was conducted from January 2010 to June 2013 at a public hospital. The couples were divided into three groups. Group DFET: the first cryotransfer of two embryos (105 women); cSFET group: the only cryotransfer of a single vitrified embryo (60 women); eSFET group, individually vitrified embryos: 20 patients included in a clinical trial of single-embryo fresh and frozen transfer and 21 patients who chose to receive eSFET. RESULTS: The clinical pregnancy rate was 38.1 % in the DET group and the cumulative clinical pregnancy rate was 43.3 % in the eSFET group. There were no significant differences between the DFET and eSFET groups (30.0 vs 34.1 %) in cumulative live birth delivery rate. The rate of multiple pregnancies varied significantly between the DFET and eSFET groups (32.5 vs 0 %, p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: For good-prognosis women aged under 38 years, taking embryo quality as a criterion for inclusion, an eSFET policy can be applied, achieving acceptable cumulative clinical pregnancy and live birth rates and reducing multiple pregnancy rates."
1168,"Research of dose-effect relationship parameters of percutaneous microwave ablation for uterine leiomyomas - a quantitative study."
1169,"Eighty eight patients with 91 uterine leiomyomas who underwent ultrasound-guided percutaneous microwave ablation (PMWA) treatment were prospectively included in the study in order to study the dose-effect relationship parameters (DERP) of PMWA for uterine leiomyomas and its relationship with T2-weighted MR imaging (T2WI). Based on the signal intensity of T2WI, uterine leiomyomas were classified as hypointense, isointense, and hyperintense. During ablation, leiomyomas were treated with quantitative microwave ablation (QMWA) energy of 50 w x 300 s or 60 w x 300 s. After QMWA, contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) was performed to evaluate DERP. No matter under 50 w x 300 s or 60 w x 300 s, quantitative microwave ablation volume (QMAV) of hyperintense leiomyoma was smaller than that of hypointense and isointense leiomyoma (P<0.016). For hypointense and isointense leiomyoma, QMAV of 60 w x 300 s was larger than that of 50 w x 300 s (P<0.05). DERPs obtained by T2WI can be used to guide the treatment of uterine leiomyoma by PMWA."
1170,"Immunogenicity and safety of Advax, a novel polysaccharide adjuvant based on delta inulin, when formulated with hepatitis B surface antigen: A randomized controlled Phase 1 study."
1171,"There is a need for additional safe and effective human vaccine adjuvants. Advax is a novel adjuvant produced from semi-crystalline particles of delta inulin. In animal studies Advax enhanced humoral and cellular immunity to hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) without inducing local or systemic reactogenicity. This first-in-man Phase 1 clinical trial tested the safety and tolerability of three intramuscular doses of HBsAg formulated with Advax in a group of healthy adult subjects. Advax was well tolerated with injection site pain scores not significantly different to subjects receiving HBsAg alone and no adverse events were reported in subjects that received Advax. Seroprotection and HBsAb geometric mean titers (GMT) after three immunizations were higher in the Advax 5mg (seroprotection 5/6, 83.3%, GMT 40.7, 95% CI 11.9-139.1) and 10mg (seroprotection 4/5, 80%, GMT 51.6, 95% CI 10.0-266.2) groups versus HBsAg alone (seroprotection 1/5, 20%, GMT 4.1, 95% CI 1.3-12.8). Similarly the proportion of subjects with positive CD4 T-cell responses to HBsAg was higher in the Advax 5mg (4/6, 67%) and Advax 10mg (4/5, 80%) groups versus HBsAg alone (1/5, 20%). These results confirm the safety, tolerability and immunogenicity of Advax adjuvant observed in preclinical studies. Advax may represent a suitable replacement for alum adjuvants in prophylactic human vaccines subject to confirmation of current results in larger studies.

1172,"Pycnodysostosis: review and case report."
1173,"AIM: Aim of the present study was to present a case report of a patient suffering from pycnodysostosis and assess how it may manifest and affect the dental/ orthodontic treatment. METHODS: An 11-year-old patient who was diagnosed with pycnodysostosis at the age of 18 months, attended the orthodontics department requiring treatment for extensive carious lesions, periodontal disease and severe crowding. RESULTS: After an accurate radiographic, clinical and orthodontic assessment of the patient taking into consideration the severity of the condition and the patient's necessities, we have formulated a treatment plan, which was accepted by both the patient and parents. We took into consideration the risks and benefits of the options available and the requests of the patient. CONCLUSION: We have decided to opt for the extraction of teeth to relieve the crowding as this was impeding good oral hygiene and hence increasing the risk of caries and periodontal disease. Such patients must be placed under an oral hygiene prevention scheme, a treatment plan must be accurately designed and the patient must be constantly motivated."
1174,"Effect of dentin powder on setting time of mineral trioxide aggregate: an in vitro study."
1175,"AIM: Mineral trioxide aggregate (MTA) is a biomaterial with numerous clinical applications in the field of endodontics. The properties of this material come closest to the requirements of an ideal endodontic repair material. Delayed setting time though may limit the use of MTA in endodontic procedures. Many chemical based additives have influenced the setting time of MTA. The aim of this paper was to evaluate the effect of a natural additive in the form of human dentin powder on setting properties of ProRoot MTA (Dentsply/Tulsa Dental, Tulsa, OK). METHODS: Thirty extracted human teeth were taken to obtain fine dentin powder. The methodology used to obtain dentin powder for the present study was same as performed by Haapsalo et al. The specimens were divided into two groups. The samples were placed in standardized stainless steel ring moulds. The setting time of MTA alone and in equal proportions with dentin powder as an additive was evaluated using Vicats apparatus. RESULTS: MTA mixed with dentin powder showed faster setting time (70 minutes) in comparison to MTA without dentin powder (120 minutes) (P<0.5). CONCLUSION: Although MTA is an ideal retrograde material with increased efficacy due to reduced setting on addition of dentin powder. A combination of MTA with dentin powder might be a viable option in procedures where fast setting of the MTA is critical."
1176,"A sudden death on clinical placement: A student's perspective of nurse grief."
1177,"Abstract This paper explores the reflections of a student nurse upon hearing of the sudden death of a patient she had cared for the previous night on clinical placement. Her journey, and those of colleagues she has observed, prompted this paper's discussion of nurse grief, the support mechanisms available and those preferred by nurses, and the potential outcomes if grief is not acknowledged, supported, and managed. Disenfranchised grief is a major factor in the development of prolonged and cumulative grief responses and negative outcomes for nurses, patients, and the collective nursing profession, however the establishment and utilisation of informal support networks has been found to encourage a discussion of feelings and lead to a healthy resolution of nurse grief."
1178,"Congestive heart failure: Predictors of health-related quality of life in Iranian women."
1179,"Abstract Background and Objectives: Identify the factors affecting quality of life (QOL) is one of the major goals for improving the Health-Related Quality of Life (HR-QOL) in patients suffering from Congestive Heart Failure (CHF). Considering the fact that there are few published studies in this regard in Iran, as a developing country, this research was designed to determine the HR-QOL in Iranian CHF patients and its related factors. METHODS AND MATERIALS: In this cross-sectional study, random sampling was used to select 1840 female CHF patients. After obtaining informed consent, patients' demographic and disease-related data (using a researcher-made questionnaire which assessed eight dimensions including role-physical, physical functioning, bodily pain, general health, vitality, role-emotional, social functioning and mental health), and the HR-QOL data (using the SF-36 questionnaire) were assessed and analyzed with SPSS version 15. RESULTS: A high proportion of the participants had an unfavorable HR-QOL in physical functioning (44.56%), role-physical (49.55%), role-emotional (59.83%), mental health (54.50%), and general health (53.36%) dimensions and a relatively favorable HR-QOL in social functioning (50.57%), vitality (49.26%), and body pain dimensions (52.55%). A significant relationship was found between the HR-QOL and the employment status, level of education, being cared for at home, functional capacity, disease duration, frequency of medical encounter and hospitalization, duration of hypertension and concurrent CHF, presence of edema, presence of disease symptoms and morbidities, intensity of fatigue at the study time and previous months, and the type of medications. CONCLUSION: According to the results, QOL in CHF patients was unfavorable in the scales of general health, role-emotional, and mental health."
1180,"Hearing, listening, action: Enhancing nursing practice through aural awareness education."
1181,"Abstract Noise overload within the clinical environment has been found to interfere with the healing process for patients, as well as nurses' ability to assess patients effectively. Awareness and responsibility for noise production begins during initial nursing training and consequently a program to enhance aural awareness skills was designed for graduate entry nursing students in an Australian university. The program utilized an innovative combination of music education activities to develop the students' ability to distinguishing individual sounds (hearing), appreciate patients' experience of sounds (listening) and improve their auscultation skills and reduce the negative effects of noise on patients (action). Using a mixed methods approach, students reported heightened auscultation skills and greater recognition of both patients' and clinicians' aural overload. Results of this pilot suggest that music education activities can assist nursing students to develop their aural awareness and to action changes within the clinical environment to improve the patient's experience of noise."
1182,"Investigating the effects of a family-centered care program on stroke patients' adherence to their therapeutic regimens."
1183,"Abstract Background: Stroke survivors have residual neurological impairment, which requires long-term support and care. In this situation family involvement in care process is necessary. However, as the family caregivers of stroke survivors are not necessarily supported by the health-care professionals, and they often feel inadequately prepared to deal with the physical, cognitive and emotional needs of the stroke survivors. AIM: The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of a family-centered care program on stroke patients' adherence to their therapeutic regimens. METHODS: This is a posttest-only randomized controlled trial study, conducted on stroke patients and their family caregivers. The control group (N = 30) received only routine hospital services and the experimental group (N = 30) received routine hospital services plus a family-centered care program consisting of four steps; need assessment, educating families based on patients' needs, follow-ups by short phone interviews, and referral service. The data were collected via a demographic data form and 'Adherence to the Therapeutic Regimens (ATR)' questionnaire between July 2011 and March 2012 and lasted 2 months for each subject. Data were assessed and analyzed with SPSS version 18. FINDINGS: Study findings showed that the levels of adherence to the different components of the therapeutic regimens, including rehabilitations, medications and dietary regimen are significantly higher in the experimental group compared to the control group (P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: By empowering patients' families and improving their ATRs, family-centered care programs will be able to play an important role in management of physical and mental health of stroke patients."
1184,"A patient safety focused registered nurse transition to practice program."
1185,"Abstract New graduate registered nurses (NGRN's) have an expectation of clinical support as they make the transition from novice to advanced beginner. In this 2008-2009 study of three rural transition to practice programs we found that clinical support did not eventuate. Consequently, NGRN's reported feeling underprepared for practice, overwhelmed by responsibility and often abandoned. Against this background, many were concerned that their inexperience had implications for safe patient care. Graduate nurse transition programs need to have the physical and human resources necessary to deliver the clinical support as promised in their prospectus, to ensure patient safety. This grounded theory study identified three essential core elements - leadership support, clinical supervision, and effective interprofessional relationships. Recommendation is made to address these deficits by mandating their inclusion in all transition to professional practice programs."
1186,"Seasonal variation in clinical remission of primary care patients with depression: impact of gender."
1187,"RATIONALE, AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: The impact of seasonal variation on clinical remission in patients with depression has not been well studied. The hypothesis for this study was that the clinical remission rate would be lower in the winter comparing to the other seasons, specifically evaluated by gender. METHODS: The study cohort comprised 2873 primary care patients with depression as a longitudinal retrospective chart review analysis. The sample was limited to patients who were continuing in care; dropouts were excluded from the analysis. RESULTS: Multivariate logistic regression analysis of the independent variables for those participants who achieved clinical remission demonstrated that for the male patients, the season of diagnosis did not impact the rate of remission at 6 months while controlling for all other independent variables. For female patients, those that were diagnosed with depression in the fall had increased likelihood of 6-month remission compared with those patients diagnosed in the winter months (OR 1.300, CI 1.006-1.680, P = 0.045) and the spring and summer patients were not significantly different in their outcome rates. When both genders were combined, the odds of remission at 6 months were not statistically significant for any season of diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that in patients who were continuing care, women who were diagnosed with major depression or dysthymia in the fall season have improved 6-month clinical outcome of remission compared with those women diagnosed in the winter, when controlling for demographic and clinical characteristics. This effect was not seen in men or when the genders were combined into a single cohort. The assessment of the seasonality effect on depression outcomes requires further long-term follow-up studies."
1188,"Lay Social Resources for Support of Adherence to Antiretroviral Prophylaxis for HIV Prevention Among Serodiscordant Couples in sub-Saharan Africa: A Qualitative Study."
1189,"Effectiveness of antiretroviral pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) for HIV prevention will require high adherence. Using qualitative data, this paper identifies potential lay social resources for support of PrEP adherence by HIV serodiscordant couples in Uganda, laying the groundwork for incorporation of these resources into adherence support initiatives as part of implementation. The qualitative analysis characterizes support for PrEP adherence provided by HIV-infected spouses, children, extended family members, and the larger community. Results suggest social resources for support of PrEP adherence in Africa are plentiful outside formal health care settings and health systems and that couples will readily use them. The same shortage of health professionals that impeded scale-up of antiretroviral treatment for HIV/AIDS in Africa promises to challenge delivery of PrEP. Building on the treatment scale-up experience, implementers can address this challenge by examining the value of lay social resources for adherence support in developing strategies for delivery of PrEP."
1190,"Clostridium difficile carriage in hospitalized cancer patients: a prospective investigation in eastern China."
1191,"BACKGROUND: Clostridium difficile carriage has been considered as a potential source for the deadly infection, but its role in cancer patients is still unclear. We aimed to identify the clinical and immunological factors that are related to C. difficile carriage in Chinese cancer patients. METHODS: A total of 400 stool samples were collected from cancer patients who received chemotherapy in three hospitals of eastern China. Bacterial genomic DNA was extracted and two toxin genes (tcdA and tcdB) were detected. PCR ribotyping was performed using capillary gel electrophoresis. Concentrations of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) and interleukin-10 (IL-10) were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kits. RESULTS: Eighty-two (20.5%) samples were confirmed to be C. difficile-positive and positive for tpi, tcdA, and tcdB genes. The C. difficile-positive rates in patients with diarrhea and no diarrhea were 35% and 19.7%, respectively (p = 0.09). Patients who were younger than 50 years old and were hospitalized for at least 10 days had a C. difficile-positive rate as high as 35%. In contrast, patients who were older than 50 years old and were hospitalized for less than 10 days had a C. difficile-positive rate of only 12.7% (p = 0.0009). No association was found between C. difficile carriage and chemotherapy regimen, antibiotic drug use, or immunosuppressive mediators, such as prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta), or interleukin-10 (IL-10). Twelve ribotypes of C. difficile were identified, but none of them belonged to ribotype 027. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that younger patients and those with longer hospitalization stays may be more prone to C. difficile carriage. Studies of larger populations are warranted to clarify the exact role of C. difficile carriage in hospitalized cancer patients in China."
1192,"Management of Pelvic Floor Disorders: Biofeedback and More."
1193,"OPINION STATEMENT: Defecatory disorders (DD) and fecal incontinence (FI) are common conditions. DD are primarily attributable to impaired rectoanal function during defecation or structural defects. FI is caused by one or more disturbances of anorectal continence mechanisms. Altered stool consistency may be the primary cause or may unmask anorectal deficits in both conditions. Diagnosis and management requires a systematic approach beginning with a thorough clinical assessment. Symptoms do not reliably differentiate a DD from other causes of constipation such as slow or normal transit constipation. Therefore, all constipated patients who do not adequately respond to medical therapy should be considered for anorectal testing to identify a DD. Preferably, two tests indicating impaired defecation are required to diagnose a DD. Patients with DD, or those for whom testing is not available and the clinical suspicion is high, should be referred for biofeedback-based pelvic floor physical therapy. Patients with FI should be managed with lifestyle modifications, pharmacotherapy for bowel disturbances, and management of local anorectal problems (e.g., hemorrhoids). When these measures are not beneficial, anorectal testing and pelvic floor retraining with biofeedback therapy should be considered. Sacral nerve stimulation or perianal bulking could be considered in patients who have persistent symptoms despite optimal management of bowel disturbances and pelvic floor retraining."
1194,"Factor analyses of a social support scale using two methods."
1195,"PURPOSE: Evaluation and comparison of the factor structure of the Medical Outcomes Study Social Support Survey (MOS-SSS) using both confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) and exploratory factor analysis (EFA) with two samples of people living with HIV/AIDS in China. METHODS: Secondary analyses were conducted with data from two comparable samples of 320 people living with HIV/AIDS from the same hospital using the same inclusion criteria. The first sample of 120 was collected in 2006, and the second sample of 200 was collected in 2012. For each sample, CFA was first performed on the original four-factor structure to check model fit, followed by EFA to explore other factor structures and a subsequent CFA for model fit statistics to be compared to the original four-factor CFA. RESULTS: In both samples, CFA on the originally hypothesized four-factor structure yielded an acceptable model fit. The EFA yielded a two-factor solution in both samples, with different items included in each factor for the two samples. Comparison of CFA on the a priori four-factor structure and the new two-factor structure in both samples indicated that both factor structures were of acceptable model fit, with the four-factor model performing slightly better than the two-factor model. CONCLUSION: Factor structure of the MOS-SSS is method-dependent, with CFA supporting a four-factor structure, while EFA yielded a two-factor structure in two separate samples. We need to be careful in selecting the analytic method when applying the MOS-SSS to various samples and choose the factor structure that best fits the theoretical model."
1196,"[Clinical pharmacology of current antiplatelet drugs.]"
1197,"Dual antiplatelet therapy with low-dose acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) and an inhibitor of the P2Y12 adenosine diphosphate (ADP) receptor is the standard treatment for patients presenting with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) or undergoing elective coronary interventions according to the current guidelines published by the European Society of Cardiology (ESC). New generation P2Y12 inhibitors, such as prasugrel and ticagrelor exert stronger and more consistent inhibition of the P2Y12 receptor. In clinical studies enrolling patients with ACS these drugs decreased the incidence of ischemic events compared to the standard therapy with clopidogrel and ASA; however, this beneficial effect was associated with an increase in bleeding events. Alternative therapeutic approaches via addition of drugs with different modes of action showed an overall reduction of ischemic events but also failed to uncouple this beneficial effect from an increased bleeding risk."
1198,"Pulmonary endarterectomy for chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension-A single-center experience in Taiwan."
1199,"BACKGROUND: Pulmonary endarterectomy (PEA) is a potentially curative surgical procedure for patients with chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension. The aim of this study is to review our institutional experience with this operation. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective review of PEA performed at our institution between January 2005 and December 2013. The measured outcomes were inhospital complications, improvement in cardiac function and exercise capacity, and actuarial survival after PEA. RESULTS: Ten consecutive patients (7 women, 3 men) underwent PEA with a mean age of 59.9 +/- 12.9 years. The preoperative New York Heart Association functional class (NYHA FC) for these patients was either Class III (n = 6) or Class IV (n = 4). The period from symptom onset to diagnosis was 34.3 +/- 37.9 months, and that from diagnosis to operation was 31.4 +/- 46.8 months. After PEA, the duration of intensive care unit stay and hospital stay prior to discharge were 9.7 +/- 5.7 days and 18.7 +/- 7.4 days, respectively. Postoperative complications included reperfusion lung edema (n = 3) and pneumonia (n = 1), and all recovered with medical therapy. After a mean follow-up of 48.4 +/- 35.1 months, all patients showed marked improvements in their clinical status and were still alive without evidence of disease recurrence. CONCLUSION: With proper patient selection, the cooperation of a multidisciplinary team, and meticulous postoperative management, PEA can be conducted safely with relatively low risk at a center with limited experience with the procedure."
1200,"Pregnancy outcomes in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus: a retrospective review of 62 pregnancies at a single tertiary center in South Korea."
1201,"OBJECTIVES: To evaluates the pregnancy outcomes in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) patients in South Korea and determine the predictive factors for adverse fetal and maternal outcomes. METHODS: All pregnancies in SLE patients who were seen at the Samsung Medical Center between November 1994 and December 2010 were included and retrospectively analyzed. SLE flares were determined by the Lupus Activity Index-Pregnancy (LAI-P) score. RESULTS: Sixty-two pregnancies were observed in 50 patients. Fifty-one (82.3%) live births and 11 (17.7%) fetal losses were observed. Thirty-eight of the live births (74.5%) were full-term and 13 (25.5%) were preterm births. Fetal losses included three spontaneous abortions, two stillbirths and six therapeutic abortions. Proteinuria during pregnancy was a predictive factor for adverse fetal outcomes (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 12.50; P = 0.032). An LAI-P score was obtained in 36 pregnancies, and SLE flares occurred in 12 pregnancies (33.3%), primarily during the second trimester (46.2%). Renal involvement (69.2%) was the most common SLE flare during pregnancy. All flares were classified as severe flare according to LAI-P scores. SLE flares during pregnancy were strongly affected by proteinuria prior to pregnancy (adjusted OR 30.28; P = 0.024) and the presence of antiphospholipid antibodies (adjusted OR 6.62; P = 0.047). CONCLUSION: Our study demonstrated a rate of live births and of flares in pregnant lupus patients comparable to recent reports in Western countries. Proteinuria during and prior to pregnancy and presence of antiphospholipid antibodies were predictive factors for poor pregnancy outcome. Preserved renal function prior to pregnancy resulted in favorable outcomes even in patients with a history of lupus nephritis."
1202,"Chronic gliosis and behavioral deficits in mice following repetitive mild traumatic brain injury."
1203,"Object With the recent increasing interest in outcomes after repetitive mild traumatic brain injury (rmTBI; e.g., sports concussions), several models of rmTBI have been established. Characterizing these models in terms of behavioral and histopathological outcomes is vital to assess their clinical translatability. The purpose of this study is to provide an in-depth behavioral and histopathological phenotype of a clinically relevant model of rmTBI. Methods The authors used a previously published weight-drop model of rmTBI (7 injuries in 9 days) in 2- to 3-month-old mice that produces cognitive deficits without persistent loss of consciousness, seizures, gross structural imaging findings, or microscopic evidence of structural brain damage. Injured and sham-injured (anesthesia only) mice were subjected to a battery of behavioral testing, including tests of balance (rotarod), spatial memory (Morris water maze), anxiety (open field plus maze), and exploratory behavior (hole-board test). After behavioral testing, brains were assessed for histopathological outcomes, including brain volume and microglial and astrocyte immunolabeling. Results Compared with sham-injured mice, mice subjected to rmTBI showed increased exploratory behavior and had impaired balance and worse spatial memory that persisted up to 3 months after injury. Long-term behavioral deficits were associated with chronic increased astrocytosis and microgliosis but no volume changes. Conclusions The authors demonstrate that their rmTBI model results in a characteristic behavioral phenotype that correlates with the clinical syndrome of concussion and repetitive concussion. This model offers a platform from which to study therapeutic interventions for rmTBI."
1204,"A reduction in both visceral and subcutaneous fats contributes to increased adiponectin by lifestyle intervention in the Diabetes Prevention Program."
1205,"AIMS: Adiponectin, an insulin-sensitizing adipokine, confers protection against type 2 diabetes. Although adiponectin is secreted exclusively from fat, contributions of visceral adipose tissue (VAT) versus subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) to adiponectin levels have not been fully understood. We aimed to examine correlations between changes in VAT and SAT volumes and changes in adiponectin levels. METHODS: Here, we have investigated the correlations between DeltaVAT and DeltaSAT with Deltaadiponectin in participants of the Diabetes Prevention Program, a clinical trial investigating the effects of lifestyle changes and metformin versus placebo on the rate of developing type 2 diabetes. Data on VAT and SAT volumes, measured by computed tomography, and on adiponectin levels at both baseline and 1-year follow-up were available in 321 men and 626 women. RESULTS: In men, Deltaadiponectin was highly significantly correlated with both DeltaSAT (r s = -0.329) and DeltaVAT (r s = -0.413). Likewise, in women, Deltaadiponectin was correlated with both DeltaSAT (r s = -0.294) and DeltaVAT (r s = -0.348). In the lifestyle arm, Deltaadiponectin remained highly significantly correlated with DeltaSAT and DeltaVAT in men (r s = -0.399 and r s = -0.460, respectively), and in women (r s = -0.372 and r s = -0.396, respectively), with P < 0.001 for all above correlations. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that for both men and women, adiponectin changes are highly significantly correlated with changes in both SAT and VAT and that exercise- and weight-loss-induced reduction in both SAT and VAT contributes to the increased adiponectin."
1206,"Increased risk of severe diabetic ketoacidosis among Jewish ultra-orthodox children."
1207,"AIMS: Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) at diabetes diagnosis is a dangerous yet potentially preventable condition. Young age, low socioeconomic status, and low parental education have been found to be associated with increased risk of DKA. We aimed to evaluate the impact of religious affiliation on presentation with DKA at type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) diagnosis in Jewish children. METHODS: The study comprised an analysis of medical records of all consecutive patients with new-onset T1DM who were admitted to one tertiary medical center from January 2007 to January 2014. DKA was defined as venous pH <7.3 or HCO3 - < 15 mmol/l, and severe DKA as pH <7.1 or HCO3 - < 5 mmol/l. RESULTS: Of 81 patients with new-onset T1DM (38 females, mean +/- SD age at diagnosis 9.9 +/- 4.2 years), 34 (42 %) presented with DKA: 21 of 60 (35 %) of patients from secular families and 13 of 21 (62 %) from ultra-orthodox families. Children from ultra-orthodox families had a 3.5-fold increased risk of presenting with DKA than children from secular families (95 % CI 1.2-10.1, p = 0.02) and a 3.8-fold risk to be admitted with severe DKA (95 % CI 1.1-12.6, p = 0.02). Other factors that were found to be associated with an increased risk of DKA were younger age, an absence of maternal academic education, and residence in an area of low socioeconomic status. CONCLUSIONS: DKA and severe DKA at diabetes diagnosis were more common among religious ultra-orthodox than among secular Jewish children. Awareness of the symptoms and dangers of DKA in new-onset T1DM should be directed to particularly high-risk population groups."
1208,"Vulnerability to sympathetic stress does not persist in Takotsubo stress cardiomyopathy."
1209,"BACKGROUND: Our objective was to investigate whether dobutamine stress echocardiography (DSE) could induce abnormal cardiac function in Takotsubo stress cardiomyopathy (TSC) patients in a stable condition after the acute attack. METHODS AND RESULTS: This study is a case-control study and a sub-study of the Stockholm Myocardial Infarction with Normal Coronaries (SMINC) study. Twenty-two patients with a previous episode of TSC and 22 sex- and age-matched controls were recruited from the SMINC study and investigated with DSE. All TSC patients had a previous normal cardiovascular magnetic resonance investigation. Tissue Doppler imaging - derived time-phases of cardiac cycle were recorded to calculate myocardial performance index (MPI) to assess ventricular function. Compared to controls at rest, TSC patients had a small but significantly higher both left ventricular MPI (LV-MPI, 0.53 vs 0.59, p=0.01) and as a trend in right ventricular MPI (RV-MPI, 0.38 vs 0.47, p=0.08) although during DSE these variables did not differ significantly. CONCLUSION: In this study we found no difference in standard diastolic parameters between TSC and controls, but a significant higher value in LV-MPI in the TSC group at rest. However, no such difference could be demonstrated during DSE between the groups indicating that vulnerability to sympathetic stimulation does not persist in TSC patients."
1210,"Application and feasibility of systemic lupus erythematosus reproductive health care quality indicators at a public urban rheumatology clinic."
1211,"OBJECTIVES: Quality indicators (QIs) are evidence-based processes of care designed to represent the current standard of care. Reproductive health QIs for the care of patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) have recently been developed, and examine areas such as pregnancy screening for autoantibodies, treatment of pregnancy-associated antiphospholipid syndrome, and contraceptive counseling. This study was designed to investigate our performance on these QIs and to explore potential gaps in care and demographic predictors of adherence to the QIs in a safety-net hospital. METHODS: We performed a record review of patients with a diagnosis of SLE at Denver Health Medical Center (DH) through an electronic query of existing medical records and via chart review. Data were limited to female patients between the ages of 18 and 50 who were seen between July 2006 and August 2011. RESULTS: A total of 137 female patients between the ages of 18 and 50 were identified by ICD-9 code and confirmed by chart review to have SLE. Of these, 122 patients met the updated 1997 American College of Rheumatology SLE criteria and had intact reproductive systems. Only 15 pregnancies were documented during this five-year period, and adherence to autoantibody screening was 100 percent. We did not have any patients who were pregnant and met criteria for pregnancy-associated antiphospholipid syndrome. Sixty-five patients (53%) received potentially teratogenic medications, and 30 (46%) had documented discussions about these medications' potential risk upon their initiation. Predictors of whether patients received appropriate counseling included younger age (OR 0.92, CI 0.87-0.98) and those who did not describe English as their primary language (OR 0.24, CI 0.07-0.87) in the multivariate analysis. CONCLUSIONS: We were able to detect an important gap in care regarding teratogenic medication education to SLE patients of childbearing potential in our public health academic clinic, as only one in two eligible patients had documented appropriate counseling at the initiation of a teratogenic medication."
1212,"Metanephric adenosarcoma: a rare case with immunohistochemistry and molecular analysis."
1213,"BackgroundMetanephric neoplasms comprised a spectrum of kidney tumors containing renal epithelial or stromal cells or both, including metanephric adenoma, metanephric stromal tumor, and metanephric adenofibroma. The majority of cases were benign; only one case of inverted question markmetanephric adenosarcoma inverted question mark had been reported in the English literature.HistoryWe present the case of a 69-year-old man who developed a neoplasm composed of renal epithelial component identical to metanephric adenoma combined with malignant spindle-cell stroma. The epithelial component was positive for CD57, AE1/AE3, but negative for WT-1, CD56, SYN, and CgA; whereas the sarcomatous component was negative for epithelial markers, SMA, Caldesmon, MyoD1, Myogenin, and S-100; and positive for vimentin, CD10, and WT1 focally. No specific sarcoma differentiation was apparent in the stroma by immunohistochemistry, and no SYT-SS18 rearrangement or BRAF mutation was detected by molecular analysis.A diagnosis of metanephric adenosarcoma was made because of the morphological features and immunohitochemistry and molecular pathology analysis.Clinical significanceWe believe that metanephric adenosarcoma should be in the expanded spectrum of metanephric neoplasia as a malignant stromal variant.ConclusionsWe report a rare case of metanephric adenosarcoma with immunohistochemistry and molecular analysis and emphasize the histopathologic features and differential diagnosis of the rare lesion to promote a better and broader understanding of this less understood subject.Virtual SlidesThe virtual slide(s) for this article can be found here: http://www.diagnosticpathology.diagnomx.eu/vs/13000_2014_179."
1214,"Cardiac stem cell niches."
1215,"The critical role that stem cell niches have in cardiac homeostasis and myocardial repair following injury is the focus of this review. Cardiac niches represent specialized microdomains where the quiescent and activated state of resident stem cells is regulated. Alterations in niche function with aging and cardiac diseases result in abnormal sites of cardiomyogenesis and inadequate myocyte formation. The relevance of Notch1 signaling, gap-junction formation, HIF-1alpha and metabolic state in the regulation of stem cell growth and differentiation within the cardiac niches are discussed."
1216,"Social values and health priority setting in Australia: An analysis applied to the context of health technology assessment."
1217,"OBJECTIVE: To describe the role of social values in priority setting related to health technology assessment processes and decision-making in Australia. APPROACH: The processes and decision criteria of the Pharmaceutical and Medical Benefits Advisory Committees are described based on literature and policy sources, and analysed using a framework for identifying social values in priority-setting. FINDINGS: Transparency and accountability of processes are apparent. Participation balances inclusiveness and effectiveness of decision-making, but presents an opportunity to enhance priority setting processes. Clinical and cost-effectiveness are important content considerations. Social values related to justice/equity are considered, without quantification of criteria weights for equity relative to other factors. HTA processes support solidarity through subsidising approved technologies for all Australians, whilst retaining autonomy by permitting non-subsidised technologies to be accessed privately, leading to possible tension between the values of solidarity, autonomy and equity. CONCLUSIONS: Priority setting related to health technology subsidy incorporates a range of inter-related social values in the processes and content of decision-making. Participation in decision-making could arguably be improved if a patient and public engagement policy were to be formulated alongside more widespread changes across processes to assess social values using approaches such as the Citizens' Jury."
1218,"STAT1 drives tumor progression in serous papillary endometrial cancer."
1219,"Recent studies of the interferon-induced transcription factor STAT1 have associated its dysregulation with poor prognosis in some cancers but its mechanistic contributions are not well defined. In this study, we report that the STAT1 pathway is constitutively upregulated in type II endometrial cancers. STAT1 pathway alteration was especially prominent in serous papillary endometrial cancers (SPEC) that are refractive to therapy. Our results defined a 'SPEC signature' as a molecular definition of its malignant features and poor prognosis. Specifically, we found that STAT1 regulated MYC as well as ICAM1, PD-L1, and SMAD7 as well as the capacity for proliferation, adhesion, migration, invasion, and in vivo tumorigenecity in cells with a high SPEC signature. Together our results define STAT1 as a driver oncogene in SPEC that modulates disease progression. We propose that STAT1 functions as a pro-survival gene in SPEC, in a manner important to tumor progression, and that STAT1 may be a novel target for molecular therapy in this disease-"
1220,"Direct chemosensitivity monitoring ex vivo on undissociated melanoma tumor tissue by impedance spectroscopy."
1221,"Stage III/IV melanoma remains incurable in most cases due to chemotherapeutic resistance. Thus, predicting and monitoring chemotherapeutic responses in this setting offer great interest. To overcome limitations of existing assays in evaluating the chemosensitivity of dissociated tumor cells, we developed a label-free monitoring system to directly analyze the chemosensitivity of undissociated tumor tissue. Using a preparation of tumor micro-fragments (TMF) established from melanoma biopsies, we characterized the tissue organization and biomarker expression by immunocytochemistry. Robust generation of TMF was established successfully and demonstrated on a broad range of primary melanoma tumors and tumor metastases. Organization and biomarker expression within the TMF was highly comparable to tumor tissue, in contrast to dissociated, cultivated tumor cells. Using isolated TMF, sensitivity to six clinically relevant chemotherapeutic drugs (dacarbazine, doxorubicin, paclitaxel, cisplatin, gemcitabine, treosulfan) were determined by impedance spectroscopy in combination with a unique microcavity array technology we developed. In parallel, comparative analyses were performed on monolayer tumor cell cultures. Lastly, we determined the efficacy of chemotherapeutic agents on TMF by impedance spectroscopy to obtain individual chemosensitivity patterns. Our results demonstrated non-predictable differences in the reaction of tumor cells to chemotherapy in TMF by comparison to dissociated, cultivated tumor cells. Our direct impedimetric analysis of melanoma biopsies offers a direct ex vivo system to more reliably predict patient-specific chemosensitivity patterns and to monitor antitumor efficacy."
1222,"GPs' attitudes on a healthy lifestyle: a survey of GPs in Flanders."
1223,"BACKGROUND: Patients often consider health professionals to be role models for leading a healthy lifestyle but no data is available on tobacco, alcohol, or substance use among GPs in Flanders (northern Belgium). AIM: To estimate the prevalence of smoking, alcohol, and substance use among GPs, in order to determine factors that influence these habits and to elucidate GPs' attitudes toward a healthy lifestyle. DESIGN AND SETTING: Online survey-based study in Flanders, Belgium. METHOD: Sociodemographic data and individual risk behaviour were collected by an anonymous self-administered questionnaire. GPs and family doctors in training were sent an email request between 1 April and 31 May 2011. RESULTS: Of 626 responders, 57% were male. The mean age was 45 years. Eight per cent (n = 50) were current smokers. Independent risk factors for smoking were: working alone, hazardous alcohol consumption, and smoking cannabis. Fourteen per cent (n = 86) consumed alcohol daily and 12% (n = 73) admitted at least one episode of binge drinking per month. Being male, cigarette smoking, cannabis use, and long working hours were associated with an increased likelihood of hazardous drinking. Sixteen per cent (n = 101) had used sleeping pills and 12% (n = 72) had used minor opiates as painkillers in the year before the study. Two-thirds (64%, n = 399) of GPs said they would be reluctant to seek medical help if they were misusing drugs or alcohol. CONCLUSION: Smoking is uncommon in Flemish GPs; in contrast, alcohol consumption is high. GPs who misuse substances will not seek help readily."
1224,"Prevalence and costs of treating uncomplicated stage 1 hypertension in primary care: a cross-sectional analysis."
1225,"BACKGROUND: Treatment for uncomplicated stage 1 hypertension is recommended in most international guidelines but there is little evidence to indicate that therapy is beneficial. AIM: To estimate the prevalence of this condition in an untreated population and the potential costs of initiating therapy in such patients. DESIGN AND SETTING: Cross-sectional study of anonymised patient records in 19 general practices in the West Midlands, UK. METHOD: Data relating to patient demographics, existing cardiovascular disease (CVD), and risk factors (blood pressure and cholesterol) were extracted from patient records. Patients with a blood pressure of 140/90-159/99 mmHg, no CVD, and <20% 10-year cardiovascular risk were classified as having uncomplicated stage 1 hypertension. Missing data were imputed. The prevalence of untreated, uncomplicated stage 1 hypertension was estimated using descriptive statistics and extrapolated using national data. The cost of achieving blood pressure control in this population was examined in a cost-impact analysis using published costs from previous studies. RESULTS: Of the 34 975 patients (aged 40-74 years) in this study, untreated, uncomplicated stage 1 hypertension was present in 2867 individuals (8.2%, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 7.9 to 8.5). This is equivalent to 1 892 519 patients in England and Wales, for whom the additional cost of controlling blood pressure, according to guidelines, was estimated at pound106-229 million per annum, depending on the health professional delivering care. CONCLUSION: Untreated, uncomplicated stage 1 hypertension is relatively common, affecting 1 in 12 patients aged 40-74 years in primary care. Current international guidelines and pay-for-performance targets, if followed, will incur significant costs for a patient benefit that is debatable."
1226,"Screening for increased cardiometabolic risk in primary care: a systematic review."
1227,"BACKGROUND: Many programmes to detect and prevent cardiovascular disease (CVD) have been performed, but the optimal strategy is not yet clear. AIM: To present a systematic review of cardiometabolic screening programmes performed among apparently healthy people (not yet known to have CVD, diabetes, or cardiometabolic risk factors) and mixed populations (apparently healthy people and people diagnosed with risk factor or disease) to define the optimal screening strategy. DESIGN AND SETTING: Systematic review of studies performed in primary care in Western countries. METHOD: MEDLINE, Embase, and CINAHL databases were searched for studies screening for increased cardiometabolic risk. Exclusion criteria were studies designed to assess prevalence of risk factors without follow-up or treatment; without involving a GP; when fewer than two risk factors were considered as the primary outcome; and studies constrained to ethnic minorities. RESULTS: The search strategy yielded 11 445 hits; 26 met the inclusion criteria. Five studies (1995-2012) were conducted in apparently healthy populations: three used a stepwise method. Response rates varied from 24% to 79%. Twenty-one studies (1967-2012) were performed in mixed populations; one used a stepwise method. Response rates varied from 50% to 75%. Prevalence rates could not be compared because of heterogeneity of used thresholds and eligible populations. Observed time trends were a shift from mixed to apparently healthy populations, increasing use of risk scores, and increasing use of stepwise screening methods. CONCLUSION: The optimal screening strategy in primary care is likely stepwise, in apparently healthy people, with the use of risk scores. Increasing public awareness and actively involving GPs might facilitate screening efficiency and uptake."
1228,"Screening for cardiovascular risk factors and self-rated health in a community setting: a cross-sectional study in Finland."
1229,"BACKGROUND: Self-rated health is an independent predictor of mortality. However, general health checks in populations unselected for disease or risk factors have not been shown to reduce mortality or morbidity. AIM: To describe new comorbidities and cardiovascular risk factors in apparently healthy people and to relate this to their self-rated health. DESIGN AND SETTING: A targeted screening programme identified 462 middle-aged people with cardiovascular risk factors without previously diagnosed chronic disease in a Finnish community in 2005-2006. METHOD: Home blood pressure monitoring, oral glucose tolerance test, estimated glomerular filtration rate, and ankle brachial index were used to detect previously undiagnosed conditions. The Short-Form Health Survey and Beck's Depression Inventory were completed by participants before the diagnostic tests were performed. RESULTS: The prevalence of previously undiagnosed disease was: hypertension 113/462 (24% [95% confidence interval {CI} = 21% to 29%]), diabetes 19/462 (4% [95% CI = 2% to 6%]), renal insufficiency 23/462 (5% [95% CI = 3% to 7%]), and peripheral arterial disease 17/462 (4% [95% CI = 2% to 5%]). Of the 139 participants who regarded their health as 'fair-poor', 60 (43%) had a previously undetected condition affecting their vasculature. CONCLUSION: Out of the screen-detected apparently healthy cardiovascular risk subjects, one in three had undiagnosed hypertension, diabetes, peripheral arterial disease, or renal insufficiency. Those individuals experiencing ill health tended to be at high risk of cardiovascular problems."
1230,"Delays in diagnosis of young females with symptomatic cervical cancer in England: an interview-based study."
1231,"BACKGROUND: Diagnosis may be delayed in young females with cervical cancer because of a failure to recognise symptoms. AIM: To examine the extent and determinants of delays in diagnosis of young females with symptomatic cervical cancer. DESIGN AND SETTING: A national descriptive study of time from symptoms to diagnosis of cervical cancer and risk factors for delay in diagnosis at all hospitals diagnosing cervical cancer in England. METHOD: One-hundred and twenty-eight patients <30 years with a recent diagnosis of cervical cancer were interviewed. Patient delay was defined as >/=3 months from symptom onset to first presentation and provider delay as >/= 3 months from first presentation to diagnosis. RESULTS: Forty (31%) patients had presented symptomatically: 11 (28%) delayed presentation. Patient delay was more common in patients <25 than patients aged 25-29 (40% versus 15%, P = 0.16). Vaginal discharge was more common among patients who delayed presentation than those who did not; many reported not recognising this as a possible cancer symptom. Provider delay was reported by 24/40 (60%); in some no report was found in primary care records of a visual inspection of the cervix and some did not re-attend after the first presentation for several months. Gynaecological symptoms were common (84%) among patients who presented via screening. CONCLUSIONS: Young females with cervical cancer frequently delay presentation, and not recognising symptoms as serious may increase the risk of delay. Delay in diagnosis after first presentation is also common. There is some evidence that UK guidelines for managing young females with abnormal bleeding are not being followed."
1232,"Stretta radiofrequency for gastroesophageal reflux disease-related respiratory symptoms: a prospective 5-year study."
1233,"AIM: The aim of the present study was to prospectively evaluate the Stretta radiofrequency (RF) treatment for gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) -related respiratory symptoms over a 5-years follow-up period. METHODS: A total of 132 patients underwent the Stretta procedure between April 2007 and February 2009; 122 of the patients (92.4%) completed the 5-year follow-up. Symptom scores and PPI usage were evaluated at baseline, 6 months, 1 year, 3 years and 5 years after treatment. RESULTS: A total of 122 patients (age, 51.7+/-13.0 years, M:F, 52: 70) were followed up for 5 years and their outcomes were analyzed. At 5 years after treatment, the symptom scores were significantly reduced (heartburn score, from 5.67+/-1.52 to 2.41+/-1.13; regurgitation score, from 5.43+/-1.66 to 2.27+/-1.33; chest pain score, from 4.45+/-1.47 to 2.40+/-0.88; cough score, from 6.62+/-1.73 to 3.14+/-1.43; and asthma score, from 6.83+/-1.46 to 3.26+/-1.53, P<0.001). Moreover, 56.6% of the patients were completely off PPIs. CONCLUSION: Stretta RF significantly improves the symptoms and reduces PPI usage at 5 years. Therefore, it is a viable, effective, and minimally invasive endoluminal procedure for patients with GERD-related respiratory symptoms."
1234,"Evaluation of the effectiveness of a polyhexanide and propyl betaine-based gel in the treatment of chronic wounds."
1235,"AIM: The objective of this multicenter observational clinical study was to evaluate the therapeutic effects of a polyhexanide and propyl betaine-based gel in the treatment of patients of every age, affected by chronic skin wounds. METHODS: One hundred twenty-four patients (60% females, from 4-day-old to 91-year-old, mean age 59) were treated with polyhexanide/propyl betaine (Prontosan(R) Wound Gel, B. Braun) applied directly on the surface of the wound and in the possible undermining, in combination with a secondary dressing. At the baseline visit and at subsequent checks were evaluated the wound diameter and characteristics (the wound bed and the surrounding skin and edges appearance, level and type of exudate) and local pain at dressing change. RESULTS: The assessment and analysis between the initial visit and the final one showed the following results: the wound size and pain characteristics have decreased substantially and significantly (P<0.001) both in the size of the wounds (length: -17.5+/-21.4 cm, width: -15.5+/-21.1 cm; area: -8.3+/-16.7 cm2) and in the intensity of pain perceived by the patient (Visual Analogue Scale [VAS]: -4.67+/-2.7; Face, Legs, Activity, Cry, Consolability [FLACC] Scale <1+/-4); for patients younger than 3 years, the scale used was FLACC. Wound bed: it was found a significant increase in the percentage of improvement in patients; 90% of them showed a reduction in the wound size, while 80% of them showed a relative reduction in pain compared with that observed during the baseline visit, with the wound bed cleansed, granulating or re-epithelializing. Just as significant was the decrease in percentage of subjects with wounds with fibrinous and partially necrotic bed, and/or with biofilm. Edges of the wound and periwound skin: the percentage of patients who have shown during the treatment an improvement in the clinical condition both of the wound edges and the surrounding skin has significantly increased, with a number of cases (75%) who have reached complete skin integrity. In a smaller percentage, already at the initial visit, the wound edges (28%) or the peristomal skin (18%) have been found undamaged. Exudate: there was a reduction in the level of exudate, with 74% of patients who showed no exudate at the final visit, compared with 15% of patients with non-exudative wounds at baseline. CONCLUSION: The treatment of chronic skin wounds through the use of a polyhexanide/propyl betaine-based gel, in combination with a secondary dressing, showed significant improvements, such as a 30% reduction of pain at dressing change, the reduction in the size and characteristics of the wounds and a reduction in the levels of exudate. All these factors have contributed to a reduction in the number of dressings, thus reducing the overall cost of treatment."
1236,"Adipocyte cell size, free fatty acids and apolipoproteins are associated with non-alcoholic liver injury progression in severely obese patients."
1237,"PURPOSE: Obesity is a modern pandemic with continuous expansion and represents an independent risk factor for non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), the most common liver disease in westernized countries. The crosstalk between adipose tissue and the liver is key to the development of NAFLD. PROCEDURES: Therefore, in an observational study blood, visceral adipose tissue and liver tissue were obtained from 93 severely obese patients with a mean age of 43years and mean BMI of 52kg/m2 at the time of weight loss surgery. In a subset of patients a follow-up blood sample was obtained 6weeks after surgery to assess acute effects of weight loss. In addition to routine parameters of liver injury, serum samples were analyzed for leptin, adiponectin, free fatty acids (FFAs), and several apolipoproteins. MAIN FINDINGS: The diameter of visceral adipocytes correlated to liver injury, serum markers of inflammation and serum adipokine levels. Liver injury assessed by serology (ALT, AST) and histology (NAFLD activity score, NAS) was independent of the BMI. However, serum levels of triglycerides and Apolipoprotein CIII (ApoCIII) were associated with NAS. Serum levels and composition of FFAs, especially long chain FFAs, also correlated with NAS. Analysis of serum samples six weeks after surgery revealed beneficial changes in serum triglycerides, levels of ApoCIII and several FFAs. CONCLUSIONS: In severely obese patients beneficial effects on liver injury can been observed as early as six weeks after bariatric surgery. These effects may be explained by the observed changes in adipose tissue and lipid metabolism. Collectively, these findings underline the importance of the link between adipose tissue and the liver."
1238,"Leptin in congenital and HIV-associated lipodystrophy."
1239,"Leptin is a hormone secreted by adipocytes that regulates energy metabolism via peripheral action on glucose synthesis and utilization as well as through central regulation of food intake. Patients with decreased amounts of fat in their adipose tissue (lipoatrophy) will have low leptin levels, and hypoleptinemic states have been associated with a variety of metabolic dysfunctions. Pronounced complications of insulin resistance, dyslipidemia and fatty liver are observed in patients suffering from congenital or acquired generalized lipodystrophy while somewhat less pronounced abnormalities are associated with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and the use of highly active antiretroviral therapy, the so-called HIV-associated lipodystrophy. Previous uncontrolled open-label studies have demonstrated that physiological doses of leptin repletion have corrected many of the metabolic derangements observed in subjects with rare fat maldistribution syndromes such as generalized lipodystrophy. In the much more commonly encountered HIV-associated lipodystrophy, leptin replacement has been shown to decrease central fat mass and to improve insulin sensitivity, dyslipidemia, and glucose levels. The United States Food and Drug Administration has recently granted approval for recombinant leptin therapy for congenital and acquired generalized lipodystrophy, however large, well-designed, placebo-controlled studies are needed to assess long-term efficacy, safety and adverse effects of leptin replacement. In this review, we present the role of leptin in the metabolic complications of congenital and acquired lipodystrophy and discuss current and emerging clinical therapeutic uses of leptin in humans with lipodystrophy."
1240,"Prevalence of persistent pain in the u.s. Adult population: new data from the 2010 national health interview survey."
1241,"Published adult prevalence estimates of chronic pain in the United States vary significantly. A more consistent pain measure is needed to assess unmet need for pain management in the general population. In this study, secondary analyses of the 2010 Quality of Life Supplement of the National Health Interview Survey are used to calculate the point prevalence of ""persistent pain,"" which we defined as constant or frequent pain persisting for at least 3 months. Rates of persistent pain are also calculated by risk group, chronic condition, and disability status. Findings show that about 19.0% of adults in the United States report persistent pain. Rates of persistent pain are higher among women, adults aged 60 to 69, adults who rate their health as fair or poor, adults who are overweight or obese, and those who were hospitalized 1 or more times in the preceding year. Most adults who report conditions such as arthritis, carpal tunnel syndrome, or back or joint pain do not describe their pain as ""persistent."" Of the estimated 39.4 million adults who report persistent pain, 67.2% say their pain is ""constantly present,"" and 50.5% say their pain is sometimes ""unbearable and excruciating."" PERSPECTIVE: Persistent pain, defined as self-reported pain ""every day"" or ""most days"" in the preceding 3 months, is a useful way to characterize health-related quality of life in the general population, and policy makers should consider including this core measure in ongoing health surveys like the National Health Interview Survey and the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey, the authors conclude."
1242,"The effect of hypocalcemia in early childhood on autism-related social and communication skills in patients with 22q11 deletion syndrome."
1243,"22q11 deletion syndrome (22qDS), also known as DiGeorge syndrome, is a copy number variant disorder that has a diverse clinical presentation including hypocalcaemia, learning disabilities, and psychiatric disorders. Many patients with 22q11DS present with signs that overlap with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) yet the possible physiological mechanisms that link 22q11DS with ASD are unknown. We hypothesized that early childhood hypocalcemia influences the neurobehavioral phenotype of 22q11DS. Drawing on a longitudinal cohort of 22q11DS patients, we abstracted albumin-adjusted serum calcium levels from 151 participants ranging in age from newborn to 19.5 years (mean 2.5 years). We then examined a subset of 20 infants and toddlers from this group for the association between the lowest calcium level on record and scores on the Communication and Symbolic Behavior Scales-Developmental Profile Infant-Toddler Checklist (CSBS-DP ITC). The mean (SD) age at calcium testing was 6.2 (8.5) months, whereas the mean (SD) age at the CSBS-DP ITC assessment was 14.7 (3.8) months. Lower calcium was associated with significantly greater impairment in the CSBS-DP ITC Social (p < 0.05), Speech (p < 0.01), and Symbolic domains (p < 0.05), in regression models adjusted for sex, age at blood draw, and age at the psychological assessment. Nevertheless, these findings are limited by the small sample size of children with combined data on calcium and CSBS-DP ITC, and hence will require replication in a larger cohort with longitudinal assessments. Considering the role of calcium regulation in neurodevelopment and neuroplasticity, low calcium during early brain development could be a risk factor for adverse neurobehavioral outcomes."
1244,"Developing minimum clinical standards for physiotherapy in South African intensive care units: the nominal group technique in action."
1245,"RATIONALE, AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: Physiotherapists form an important part of the inter-professional team that cares for critically ill patients in intensive care units (ICU). No formalized clinical practice guidelines or standards exist for the educational profile or scope of practice requirements for physiotherapy within critical care, which poses a threat to physiotherapy practice and professional credibility. METHODS: The aim of this paper was to describe the nominal group technique (NGT) used to identify the minimum standards of clinical practice needed by physiotherapists to ensure safe and independent practice in South African ICUs. RESULTS: Twenty-five subjects participated in one of three forums. Sixty-six concepts were considered in the three domains (knowledge, skills and attitudes). Not all concepts were discussed by all three focus groups. Just over half (54% n = 14) the concepts generated in the knowledge domain; a third of the concepts (35% n = 7) generated in the skills domain and only 10% (n = 2) of attitudes were consistently raised by all three groups. Almost two-thirds of the concepts generated (62% n = 41) were considered in more than one domain. Only six concepts reached the threshold consensus level across all three focus groups, four knowledge parameters and two skills. CONCLUSION: The NGT allowed for the cross-stimulation of ideas in an engaging yet anonymous and structured manner. The importance of discussion in reaching consensus is highlighted. Going forward, it is intended to use the concepts generated through this process as the foundation for further consensus-building activities among the wider physiotherapy and intensive care communities."
1246,"Evaluation of preoperative geriatric assessment of elderly patients with colorectal carcinoma. A retrospective study."
1247,"AIMS: Elderly patients with colorectal carcinoma are screened with the Identification of Seniors at Risk (ISAR) questionnaire to identify frail patients. These patients are more at risk for mortality and morbidity and are referred to the geriatric specialist for assessment (Dutch acronym: DOG). The DOG assessment aims to preoperatively optimize the patient in order to improve postoperative outcomes. This study evaluates if the DOG assessment influences postoperative outcome after colorectal surgery. METHODS: Retrospective cohort and match-control study. Elderly patients who underwent elective resection between 01-01-2008 and 01-08-2013 in the Medical Centre Alkmaar were included. Patients with a positive ISAR score were referred to the geriatric specialists for DOG assessment (DOG patients). DOG assessment encompassed comprehensive geriatric assessment and interventions. PRIMARY OUTCOMES: Mortality, delirium and length of hospital stay. Secondary outcomes: postoperative complications. COHORT COMPARISON: Cohort ISAR- (2008-2010, no ISAR questionnaire) is compared with cohort ISAR+ (2011-2013, ISAR questionnaire). Match-control comparison: DOG patients are compared with matched controls from cohort ISAR-. RESULTS: Compared to their matched controls, DOG patients were older and had a higher prevalence of certain risk factors for postoperative delirium. In both comparisons, no statistical significant differences were found between the groups in mortality and postoperative delirium. Length of stay was significantly shorter in cohort ISAR+. CONCLUSIONS: While the DOG patients were significantly more at risk for postoperative complications, the DOG patients had comparable postoperative outcomes as their matched controls. We therefore conclude that the DOG assessment has a positive influence on the postoperative outcomes after colorectal surgery."
1248,"Novel personalized therapy for cystic fibrosis: treating the basic defect in all patients."
1249,"Cystic Fibrosis (CF) is the most common genetic life-shortening condition in Caucasians. Despite being a multi-organ disease, CF is classically diagnosed by symptoms of acute/chronic respiratory disease, with persistent pulmonary infections and mucus plugging of the airways and failure to thrive. These multiple symptoms originate from dysfunction of the CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) protein, a channel that mediates anion transport across epithelia. Indeed, establishment of a definite CF diagnosis requires proof of CFTR dysfunction, commonly through the so-called 'sweat Cl- test'. Many drug therapies, including mucolytics and antibiotics, aim to alleviate the symptoms of CF lung disease. However, new therapies to modulate defective CFTR, the basic defect underlying CF, have started to reach the clinic and several others are in development or in clinical trials. The novelty of these therapies is that, besides targeting the basic defect underlying CF, they are mutation specific. Indeed, even this monogenic disease is influenced by a large number of different genes and biological pathways as well as by environmental factors that are difficult to assess. Accordingly, every person with CF is unique and so functional assessment of patients' tissues ex vivo is key for diagnosing and predicting the severity of this disease. Of note, such assessment will also be crucial to assess drug responses, in order to effectively treat all CF patients. It is not because it is a monogenic disorder that personalized treatment for CF is much easier than for complex disorders. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved."
1250,"Breast cancer survival in New Zealand women."
1251,"BACKGROUND: The Quality Audit (BQA) of Breast Surgeons of Australia and New Zealand includes a broad range of data and is the largest New Zealand (NZ) breast cancer (BC) database outside the NZ Cancer Registry. We used BQA data to compare BC survival by ethnicity, deprivation, remoteness, clinical characteristic and case load. METHODS: BQA and death data were linked using the National Health Index. Disease-specific survival for invasive cases was benchmarked against Australian BQA data and NZ population-based survivals. Validity was explored by comparison with expected survival by risk factor. RESULTS: Compared with 93% for Australian audit cases, 5-year survival was 90% for NZ audit cases overall, 87% for Maori, 84% for Pacific and 91% for other. CONCLUSIONS: BC survival in NZ appears lower than in Australia, with inequities by ethnicity. Differences may be due to access, timeliness and quality of health services, patient risk profiles, BQA coverage and death-record methodology."
1252,"The influence of environmental exposure on the response to antimicrobial treatment in pulmonary Mycobacterial avium complex disease."
1253,"BACKGROUND: Environmental exposure is a likely risk factor for the development of pulmonary Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) disease. The influence of environmental exposure on the response to antimicrobial treatment and relapse is unknown. METHODS: We recruited 72 patients with pulmonary MAC disease (male [female], 18 [54]; age, 61.7 +/- 10.3 years) who initiated and completed standard three-drug regimens for more than 12 months between January 2007 and December 2011. The factors associated with sputum conversion, relapse and treatment success without relapse were retrospectively evaluated after adjustments for confounding predictors. RESULTS: Fifty-two patients (72.2%) demonstrated sputum conversion, and 15 patients (28.8%) relapsed. A total of 37 patients (51.4%) demonstrated treatment success. Sputum conversion was associated with negative smears (odds ratio [OR], 2.80; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.02-7.83; P = 0.045) and the absence of cavities or a cavity size of <2 cm (OR, 4.08; 95% CI, 1.36-12.70; P = 0.01). A relapse occurred in patients with low soil exposure after the start of treatment less frequently than in patients with high soil exposure (7/42 [16.7%] vs. 8/10 [80.0%], P = 0.0003). Treatment success was associated with low soil exposure after the beginning of treatment (OR, 13.46; 95% CI, 3.24-93.43; P = 0.0001) and a negative smear (OR, 2.97; 95% CI, 1.02-9.13; P = 0.047). CONCLUSION: Low soil exposure was independently associated with better microbiological outcomes in patients with pulmonary MAC disease after adjusting for confounding clinical, microbiological and radiographic findings."
1254,"Transcatheter closure of atrial septal defect associated with arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy: a case report and literature review."
1255,"Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy is characterised by progressive, fibrofatty replacement of myocardium, and ventricular arrhythmias, and its prognosis is usually poor. Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy associated with atrial septal defect is very rare, and this combination may make the diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis difficult. We present a case of a patient with this association who underwent interventional treatment with a septal defect occluder. Transcatheter closure of atrial septal defect in a patient with arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy is hitherto unreported. During a 3-year follow-up he remained relatively stable. We also review the cases reported in the medical literature describing this uncommon association between arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy and atrial septal defect or patent foramen ovale."
1256,"The role of nitisinone in tyrosine pathway disorders."
1257,"Nitisinone 2-(2-nitro-4-trifluoromethylbenzoyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione (NTBC), an effective herbicide, is the licensed treatment for the human condition, hereditary tyrosinaemia type 1 (HT-1). Its mode of action interrupts tyrosine metabolism through inhibition of 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase (HPPD). Nitisinone is a remarkable safe drug to use with few side effects reported. Therefore, we propose that it should be investigated as a potential treatment for other disorders of tyrosine metabolism. These include alkaptonuria (AKU), a rare disease resulting is severe, early-onset osteoarthritis. We present a case study from the disease, and attempts to use the drug both off-label and in clinical research through the DevelopAKUre consortium."
1258,"The mammalian Hippo pathway: regulation and function of YAP1 and TAZ."
1259,"The Hippo pathway was originally identified as the signaling that controls organ size in Drosophila, with the core architecture conserved in mammals. In the mammalian Hippo pathway, mammalian Ste20-like kinases (MST1/2) and large tumor suppressor kinases (LATS1/2) regulate transcriptional co-activators, Yes-associated protein (YAP1) and Transcriptional co-activator with a PDZ-binding motif (TAZ). The Hippo pathway was initially thought to be quite straightforward; however, the identification of additional components has revealed its inherent complexity. Regulation of YAP1 and TAZ is not always dependent on MST1/2 and LATS1/2. MST1/2 and LATS1/2 play various YAP1/TAZ-independent roles, while YAP1 and TAZ cross-talk with other signaling pathways. In this review we focus on YAP1 and TAZ and discuss their regulation, function, and the consequences of their dysregulation."
1260,"RESOLVE: a randomized, controlled, blinded study of bioabsorbable steroid-eluting sinus implants for in-office treatment of recurrent sinonasal polyposis."
1261,"BACKGROUND: Patients with recurrent sinonasal polyposis after endoscopic sinus surgery (ESS) have limited treatment options. This study evaluated the safety and efficacy of a bioabsorbable steroid-eluting implant with 1350 mug of mometasone furoate for its ability to dilate obstructed ethmoid sinuses, reduce polyposis, and reestablish sinus patency. METHODS: This was a randomized, controlled, blinded study including 100 patients chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis (CRSwNP) refractory to medical therapy and considered candidates for revision ESS. Follow-up included endoscopic grading by investigators and patient-reported outcomes. RESULTS: Treated patients (n = 53; age as mean +/- standard deviation [SD] 47.8 +/- 12.6 years; 55% male) underwent in-office bilateral placement. Control patients (n = 47; age 51.6 +/- 13.1 years; 66% male) underwent a sham procedure. At 3 months, treated patients experienced a significant reduction in bilateral polyp grade (p = 0.0269) and ethmoid sinus obstruction (p = 0.0001) compared to controls. Treated patients also experienced a 2-fold improvement in the mean nasal obstruction/congestion score (-1.33 +/- 1.47 vs -0.67 +/- 1.45; p = 0.1365). This improvement reached statistical significance (p = 0.025) in patients with greater polyp burden (grade >/=2 bilaterally; n = 74). At 3 months, 53% of treated patients compared to only 23% of controls were no longer indicated for repeat ESS. There was no serious adverse event or clinically significant increases in intraocular pressure or cataract formation. CONCLUSION: The symptomatic improvement and statistically significant reduction in polyp grade and ethmoid sinus obstruction supported the efficacy of the steroid-eluting implant for in-office treatment of CRS patient with recurrent polyposis after ESS. The study results demonstrated that the steroid-eluting implant represents a safe and effective alternative to current management for this patient population."
1262,"Variation in the risk of progression between glycemic stages across different levels of body mass index: evidence from a United States electronic health records system."
1263,"Abstract Objective: The purpose of this study was to assess how the risks of glycemic stage transitions observed in clinical practice vary with body mass index (BMI). These transitions included progression from euglycemia (""normal"") to prediabetes (PreD) and from PreD to type 2 diabetes (T2D), as well from normal directly to T2D, and reversions from PreD to normal. Methods: We examined the Geisinger Health System electronic health records and insurance claims data, segmenting a subject's medical history into normal, PreD, and/or T2D glycemic stages via diagnosis codes, glycosylated hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) or fasting plasma glucose lab results, and use of anti-diabetic drugs. Weibull survival models, adjusted for age, gender, race, and smoking, were used to estimate the glycemic progression hazard ratios for BMI categories relative to normal BMI. Results: The sample included 32,864 adults with normal glycemic levels at baseline and 4,483 with PreD. The adjusted hazard ratios for normal to PreD progression ranged from 1.8 (25</=BMI<30 kg/m2) to 6.5 (BMI>/=40 kg/m2); for PreD to T2D, 1.3 to 2.9; for normal to T2D, 1.8 to 9.5; and for PreD to normal, approximately 0.7 across all BMI. Limitations: The glycemic transitions may be recognized after the true onset since periodic glycemic testing was not required across the study population. Conclusions: A positive association between the risks of progression along the glycemic continuum and BMI levels was observed in a real-world United States practice setting."
1264,"Does arthroscopic sub-acromial decompression really work for sub-acromial impingement syndrome: a cohort study."
1265,"BACKGROUND: Health Economists in Denmark have reported poor outcomes and low and delayed return to work for patients treated for Sub-Acromial Impingement syndrome (SAIS) by Arthroscopic Sub-Acromial Decompression (ASAD). In this setting it is important to evaluate outcomes following this commonly performed operation to justify undertaking it on our patients. The purpose of the study was to evaluate the effectiveness of ASAD for patients with SAIS and correlate clinical outcome with rate of return to work. METHODS: Prospective cohort study and retrospective review of data from the Nottingham Shoulder database. Inclusion criteria: Patients diagnosed clinically with SAIS by an experienced shoulder surgeon, who have failed conservative treatment (physiotherapy and sub-acromial injection), undergoing ASAD. Pre-operative and 6-month post-operative Oxford Shoulder Score (OSS) and Constant Score (CS) were compared. The rates of return to pre-operative work and hobbies were also analysed. Statistical analysis was carried out using the Wilcoxon signed rank test. RESULTS: 73 patients with OSS (51 also with CS documentation) were included. The improvement in median OSS between pre-operative (24) and 6-month follow-up (39) was +15 (Z = -6.726, p < 0.0001, T = 6, r = 0.55). The difference in median CS between pre-operative (39) and 6-month follow-up (67) was +28 (Z = -5.435, p < 0.0001,T = 6, r = 0.59). Improvement in median pain score was +5 (7,12, p < 0.0001) median ADL was +5.5 (10.5,16, p < 0.0001) median ROM was +13 (18,31, p < 0.0001) and median strength was +4 (3,7, p < 0.0001). 76% returned to their pre-operative level of work (mean time = 11.5 weeks post surgery). 79% returned to pre-operative hobbies at a mean of 11.8 weeks after surgery. CONCLUSION: There is a significant improvement in both subjective and objective outcome 6 months after ASAD in patients with SAIS who have had previous failed conservative treatment. The rate of return to work was good for these patients in contrast to that reported for Danish patients. ASAD is a successful method of treatment for patients with SAIS who have had an initial trial of failed conservative treatment."
1266,"Quantitative in vivo analysis of small bowel motility using MRI examinations in mice - proof of concept study."
1267,"Small bowel motility analyses using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) could reduce current invasive techniques in animal studies and comply with the 'three Rs' rule for human animal experimentation. Thus we investigated the feasibility of in vivo small bowel motility analyses in mice using dynamic MRI acquisitions. All experimental procedures were approved by the institutional animal care committee. Six C57BL/6 mice underwent MRI without additional preparation after isoflurane anaesthetization in the prone position on a 4.7 T small animal imager equipped with a linear polarized hydrogen birdcage whole-body mouse coil. Motility was assessed using a true fast imaging in a steady precession sequence in the coronal orientation (acquisition time per slice 512 ms, in-plane resolution 234 x 234 microm, matrix size 128 x 128, slice thickness 1 mm) over 30 s corresponding to 60 acquisitions. Motility was manually assessed measuring the small bowel diameter change over time. The resulting motility curves were analysed for the following parameters: contraction frequency per minute (cpm), maximal contraction amplitude (maximum to minimum [mm]), luminal diameter (mm) and luminal occlusion rate. Small bowel motility quantification was found to be possible in all animals with a mean small bowel contraction frequency of 10.67 cpm (SD +/- 3.84), a mean amplitude of the contractions of 1.33 mm (SD +/- 0.43) and a mean luminal diameter of 1.37 mm (SD +/- 0.42). The mean luminal occlusion rate was 1.044 (SD +/- 0.45%/100). The mean duration needed for a single motility assessment was 185 s (SD +/- 54.02). Thus our study demonstrated the feasibility of an easy and time-sparing functional assessment for in vivo small bowel motility analyses in mice. This could improve the development of small animal models of intestinal diseases and provide a method similar to clinical MR examinations that is in concordance with the 'three Rs' for humane animal experimentation."
1268,"Differential mechanisms of action of the mucolipin synthetic agonist, ML-SA1, on insect TRPML and mammalian TRPML1."
1269,"Mucolipin synthetic agonist 1 (ML-SA1) was recently identified to activate mammalian TRPML channels and shown to alleviate lipid accumulation in lysosomes of cellular models of lysosome storage diseases, mucolipidosis type IV (MLIV) and Niemann-Pick's disease type C (NPC). Owning to its potential use in complimenting genetic studies in Drosophila melanogaster to elucidate the cellular and physiological functions of TRPML channels, we examined the effect of ML-SA1 on Drosophila TRPML expressed in HEK293 cells using whole-cell, inside-out, and whole-lysosome electrophysiological recordings. We previously showed that when expressed in HEK293 cells, Drosophila TRPML was localized and functional on both plasma membrane and endolysosome. We show here that in both inside-out patches excised from the plasma membrane and whole-lysosome recordings from enlarged endolysosome vacuoles, ML-SA1 failed to activate TRPML unless exogenous phosphatidylinositol 3,5-bisphosphate [PI(3,5)P2] was applied. At 1muM ML-SA1, the sensitivity of TRPML to PI(3,5)P2 increased approximately by 10-fold and at 10muM ML-SA1, the deactivation of PI(3,5)P2-evoked TRPML currents was markedly slowed. On the other hand, constitutive activation of TRPML by a mutation that mimics the varitint-waddler (Va) mutation of mouse TRPML3 rendered the insect channel sensitive to activation by ML-SA1 alone. Moreover, different from the insect TRPML, mouse TRPML1 was readily activated by ML-SA1 independent of PI(3,5)P2. Thus, our data reveal that while ML-SA1 acts as a true agonist at mouse TRPML1, it behaves as an allosteric activator of the Drosophila TRPML, showing dependence on and the ability to stabilize open conformation of the insect channels."
1270,"Placental gene expression of transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-beta1) in small for gestational age newborns."
1271,"Abstract Objective: The gene expression of transforming growth factor beta-1 (TGF-beta1) in human placental samples obtained from pregnancies with small for gestational age fetuses (SGA) was compared to those of normal pregnancies. Methods: In 2011 placental samples from 101 pregnancies with SGA and from 140 normal pregnancies were obtained for analysis of TGF-beta1 gene expression. Several clinical parameters were also assessed for correlation between genetic and clinical parameters. Results: There were no significant differences in gene activity of the TGF-beta1 gene between the SGA vs. normal pregnancy groups (Ln2alpha: 0.16; p=0.07). Within the SGA group, no fetal gender-dependent differences were seen in TGF-beta1 gene expression (Ln2alpha: -0.11; p=0.05). Similarly, no significant differences in gene activity were observed by the degree of severity of SGA as assessed by percentile fetal birthweight (Ln2alpha: 0.32; p=0.06). Conclusion: We found no change in gene expression of TGF-beta1 in placental samples obtained from SGA pregnancies vs. normal pregnancy suggesting an absence of a direct role of the TGF-beta1 gene in the development of SGA. However, the absence of increased gene expression of TGF-beta1 in SGA can be conceptualized as a failure to mount a compensatory response in the SGA environment."
1272,"Correlation of PCSK9 Gene Polymorphism with Cerebral Ischemic Stroke in Xinjiang Han and Uygur Populations."
1273,"Background Cerebral ischemic stroke (CIS) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality. Its main pathological basis is atherosclerosis (AS); in turn, the main risk factor in AS is dyslipidemia. Human proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin9 (PCSK9) plays a key role in regulating plasma low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels. We sought to assess the association between PCSK9 and CIS in Chinese Han and Uygur populations. Material and Methods We selected 408 CIS patients and 348 control subjects and used a single-base terminal extension (SNaPshot) method to detect the genotypes of the 20 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in PCSK9. Results Distribution of SNP8 (rs529787) genotypes showed a significant difference between CIS and control participants (P=0.049). However, when analyzing Han and Uygur populations separately, we found that only Han subjects showed distribution of SNP1 (rs1711503), SNP2 (rs2479408), and SNP8 (rs529787) alleles that was significantly different between CIS and control participants (P=0.028, P=0.013, P=0.006, respectively), and distribution of SNP2 (rs2479408) in the dominant model (CC vs. CG + GG) was significantly different between CIS and control participants (P=0.013), even after adjustment for covariates (OR: 75.262, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 7.232-783.278, P<0.001). Distribution of the 2 haplotypes (A-C and G-C) (rs1711503 and rs2479408) was significantly different between CIS and control participants (both, P=0.011). Conclusions Both rs1711503 and rs2479408 of PCSK9 genes were associated with CIS in the Han population of China. A-C haplotype may be a genetic marker of CIS risk in this population."
1274,"Associations of Daytime, Nighttime, and 24-Hour Heart Rate With Four Distinct Markers of Inflammation in Hypertensive Patients: The Styrian Hypertension Study."
1275,"The current study assessed which measure of heart rate (HR) is most associated with inflammatory activity. Among 368 hypertensive patients (mean age+/-standard deviation, 60.6+/-10.8; 52.9% women), mean daytime (from 6 am to 10 pm), nighttime (from 10 pm to 6 am), and 24-hour HR were recorded using a continuous 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring portable device. Associations of daytime, nighttime, and 24-hour HR with leukocytes, platelets, C-reactive protein (CRP), and 25-hydroxyvitamin D were calculated using multivariate linear regression, reporting unstandardized coefficients (B) with standard errors (SEs). Mean daytime, nighttime, and 24-hour HR were 73, 64, and 71 beats per minute, respectively. All HR measures were positively associated with leukocytes after adjustment. Nighttime HR was additionally related with higher CRP. When all HR measures were simultaneously added to a single multivariate model, only the positive associations of nighttime HR with leukocytes (B [SE]=0.06 [0.03], P=.04), as well as with CRP (B [SE]=0.20 [0.07], P=.005), persisted. Nighttime HR was more closely associated with inflammatory activity. These observations lend some insight toward the pathophysiological mechanisms that implicate HR in cardiovascular risk and provide valuable direction for forthcoming investigations."
1276,"Low-frequency pitch perception in children with cochlear implants in comparison to normal hearing peers."
1277,"The aim of the present study was to investigate the application of two new pitch perception tests in children with cochlear implants (CI) and to compare CI outcomes to normal hearing (NH) children, as well as investigating the effect of chronological age on performance. The tests were believed to be linked to the availability of Temporal Fine Structure (TFS) cues. 20 profoundly deaf children with CI (5-17 years) and 31 NH peers participated in the study. Harmonic Intonation (HI) and Disharmonic Intonation (DI) tests were used to measure low-frequency pitch perception. HI/DI outcomes were found poorer in children with CI. CI and NH groups showed a statistically significant difference (p < 0.001). HI scores were better than those of DI test (p < 0.001). Chronological age had a significant effect on DI performance in NH group (p < 0.05); children under the age of 8.5 years showed larger inter-subject-variability; however, the majority of NH children showed outcomes that were considered normal at adult-level. For the DI test, bimodal listeners had better performance than when listening with CI alone. HI/DI tests were applicable as clinical tools in the pediatric population. The majority of CI users showed abnormal outcomes on both tests confirming poor TFS processing in the hearing-impaired population. Findings indicated that the DI test provided more differential low-frequency pitch perception outcomes in that it reflected phase locking and TFS processing capacities of the ear, whereas HI test provided information of its place coding capacity as well."
1278,"MicroRNA-10a-5p and microRNA-34c-5p in laryngeal epithelial premalignant lesions: differential expression and clinicopathological correlation."
1279,"This study was to analyze the dys-regulation of microRNA-10a-5p and microRNA-34c-5p and their correlations with clinicopathological characteristics of laryngeal epithelial premalignant lesions (LEPL). Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction was performed to detect the expression of microRNA-10a-5p and microRNA-34c-5p in 94 cases of LEPL and 47 controls. Retrospective follow-up data of all patients were collected and the correlation between the dys-regulation of microRNA-10a-5p/microRNA-34c-5p and clinicopathological characteristics was examined by linear regression analysis. Expression of microRNA-10a-5p was down-regulated in LEPL, showing statistical difference between low-risk lesion group and high-risk lesion group, while microRNA-34c-5p expression was up-regulated gradually in LEPL groups and dropped suddenly in squamous cell carcinoma group. In addition, the differential expression of microRNA-10a-5p is profiled with either LEPL grade or gender, showing a linear correlation; and microRNA-34c-5p expression is correlated with alcohol consumption in LEPL patients (P < 0.05). The dys-regulation of microRNA-10a-5p and microRNA-34c-5p in LEPL and their correlations with clinicopathological characteristics might provide important theoretical and experimental basis for LEPL classfication and the two microRNAs can serve as more valuable markers in diagnosis and clinical management of LEPL."
1280,"Does preoperative biliary drainage compromise the long-term survival of patients with pancreatic head carcinoma?"
1281,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to determine the impact of preoperative biliary drainage (PBD) on long-term survival in patients with pancreatic head carcinoma after surgical resection. METHODS: Medical records of 160 patients with pancreatic head carcinoma who underwent surgical resection were reviewed retrospectively. Clinicopathological parameters including long-term survival were compared between patients who did and did not undergo PBD. RESULTS: Overall survival of patients who underwent PBD (n = 93) was significantly worse than that of patients who did not (n = 67) by univariate analysis (P = 0.030). However, multivariate analysis revealed that PBD was not an independent prognostic factor for overall survival (P = 0.227). Patients who underwent percutaneous transhepatic biliary drainage (PTBD) had significantly worse survival than patients who underwent endoscopic retrograde biliary drainage (ERBD, P = 0.038) and patients who did not undergo PBD (P = 0.001). The rate of peritoneal recurrence in patients who underwent PTBD was significantly higher than that of patients who underwent ERBD (P = 0.033) or patients who did not undergo PBD (P = 0.034). CONCLUSIONS: PBD may not affect the long-term survival of patients with pancreatic head carcinoma if ERBD is used. J. Surg. Oncol. (c) 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc."
1282,"Networking and data sharing reduces hospitalization cost of heart failure: the experience of GISC study."
1283,"RATIONALE, AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: Heart failure (HF) is a concerning public health burden in Western society because, despite the improvement of medical treatments, it is still associated with adverse outcomes (high morbidity and mortality), resulting in one of the most expensive chronic disease in Western countries. Hospital admission particularly is the most expensive cost driver among the several resources involved in the management of HF. The aim of our study was to investigate the cost of hospitalization before and after the enrolment to a new strategy (GISC) in the management of patients with HF. METHODS: We enrolled a cohort of 90 patients. Patients were eligible to the study if they were hospitalized with a new diagnosis of HF or a diagnosis of decompensated HF. The enrolment to the study corresponded to the enrolment to the GISC intervention. We calculated the cost for every hospital admission at 6 and 12 months before and after the enrolment using the tariff paid for the diagnosis-related group. RESULTS: Comparing per-patient cumulative cost before and after the enrolment, we showed that patient's hospitalization was less expensive after the enrolment to the GISC intervention. The strategy resulted in an average cumulative estimated saving of euro439 322.00 (95% CI euro413 890.70; euro464 753.40) at 6 months and of euro832 276.80 (95% CI euro786 863.70; euro877 690.00) at 12 months after the enrolment. CONCLUSIONS: We found out that the intervention was a cost-saving strategy for follow-up of the patients suffering from HF at 6 and 12 months after the enrolment compared with hospitalizations' cost before the recruitment."
1284,"Repeated episodes of chronic intermittent ethanol promote insensitivity to devaluation of the reinforcing effect of ethanol."
1285,"Studies in animal models have shown that repeated episodes of alcohol dependence and withdrawal promote escalation of drinking that is presumably associated with alterations in the addiction neurocircuitry. Using a lithium chloride-ethanol pairing procedure to devalue the reinforcing properties of ethanol, the present study determined whether multiple cycles of chronic intermittent ethanol (CIE) exposure by vapor inhalation also alters the sensitivity of drinking behavior to the devaluation of ethanol's reinforcing effects. The effect of devaluation on operant ethanol self-administration and extinction was examined in mice prior to initiation of CIE (short drinking history) and after repeated cycles of CIE or air control exposure (long drinking history). Devaluation significantly attenuated the recovery of baseline ethanol self-administration when tested either prior to CIE or in the air-exposed controls that had experienced repeated bouts of drinking but no CIE. In contrast, in mice that had undergone repeated cycles of CIE exposure that promoted escalation of ethanol drinking, self-administration was completely resistant to the effect of devaluation. Devaluation had no effect on the time course of extinction training in either pre-CIE or post-CIE mice. Taken together, these results are consistent with the suggestion that repeated cycles of ethanol dependence and withdrawal produce escalation of ethanol self-administration that is associated with a change in sensitivity to devaluation of the reinforcing properties of ethanol."
1286,"Overuse Activity in the Presence of Scapular Dyskinesis Leads to Shoulder Tendon Damage in a Rat Model."
1287,"Shoulder tendon injuries are common clinical conditions and are a significant source of pain and dysfunction. These conditions are more common in individuals who perform repetitive overhead activities and in individuals who have abnormal scapular kinematics, termed scapular dyskinesis (SD). However, the long term consequences associated with overuse activity in the presence of SD are unknown. Therefore, the objective of this study was to determine the effect of overuse in combination with SD on joint mechanics and properties of the rotator cuff and biceps tendons. A rat model of scapular dyskinesis was used. Ninety adult male Sprague-Dawley rats (400-450 g) were randomized into three groups: nerve transection (SD), sham nerve transection + overuse (OV), or nerve transection + overuse (SD + OV). Rats were sacrificed at 2, 4, and 8 weeks after surgery. Shoulder function and passive joint mechanics were evaluated over time and tendon properties (mechanical, histological, organizational, and compositional) were measured. Results demonstrated that overuse activity and SD are each independently detrimental to tendon properties (e.g., diminished mechanical properties, disorganized collagen). However, tendon damage caused by the addition of overuse may be worse, with more parameters altered, than damage caused by the addition of SD. This study helps define the mechanical mechanisms leading to tendon damage and provides a framework for distinguishing treatment strategies for active patients and those with abnormal scapular mechanics."
1288,"Prediction of Kinematic and Kinetic Performance in a Drop Vertical Jump with Individual Anthropometric Factors in Adolescent Female Athletes: Implications for Cadaveric Investigations."
1289,"Anterior cruciate ligament injuries are common, expensive to repair, and often debilitate athletic careers. Robotic manipulators have evaluated knee ligament biomechanics in cadaveric specimens, but face limitations such as accounting for variation in bony geometry between specimens that may influence dynamic motion pathways. This study examined individual anthropometric measures for significant linear relationships with in vivo kinematic and kinetic performance and determined their implications for robotic studies. Anthropometrics and 3D motion during a 31 cm drop vertical jump task were collected in high school female basketball players. Anthropometric measures demonstrated differential statistical significance in linear regression models relative to kinematic variables (p-range <0.01-0.95). However, none of the anthropometric relationships accounted for clinical variance or provided substantive univariate accuracy needed for clinical prediction algorithms (r 2 < 0.20). Mass and BMI demonstrated models that were significant (p < 0.05) and predictive (r 2 > 0.20) relative to peak flexion moment, peak adduction moment, flexion moment range, abduction moment range, and internal rotation moment range. The current findings indicate that anthropometric measures are less associated with kinematics than with kinetics. Relative to the robotic manipulation of cadaveric limbs, the results do not support the need to normalize kinematic rotations relative to specimen dimensions."
1290,"Evaluation of a novel breast reconstruction technique using the Braxon acellular dermal matrix: a new muscle-sparing breast reconstruction."
1291,"BACKGROUND: Implant-based breast reconstruction is becoming increasingly popular because of the widespread adoption of acellular dermal matrix (ADM), which allows surgeons to obtain good aesthetic results with fewer operations. To develop more conservative surgical techniques, a retrospective, three-centre, proof-of-concept study was performed to study the effectiveness of a new, immediate, muscle-sparing breast reconstruction technique using the patented Braxon(R) ADM, which enables subcutaneous positioning of the breast implant without detaching the pectoralis major. METHODS: Ethics committee of the study coordinating centre approved medical record review on 19 women who underwent muscle-sparing breast reconstruction between November 2012 and January 2014. The first 10 implants were performed using 0.9-mm-thick porcine ADM, with preservatives. In the subsequent 15 implants, the product was changed to 0.6-mm-thick porcine dry ADM, without preservatives. RESULTS: Nineteen patients (25 implants) received six bilateral and 13 unilateral muscle-sparing breast reconstructions. For the first type of ADM used (0.9-mm-thick with preservatives), the rate of implant loss was 12% (n = 3) because of seroma (8%, n = 2) and infection (4%, n = 1). Minor complications, such as seroma (8%, n = 2), occurred when using the 0.6-mm-thick Braxon(R) ADM and were treated by aspiration. Symmetrical and natural breasts with good shape, ptosis and softness to the touch were obtained. None of the patients reported experiencing pain. CONCLUSIONS: The preliminary results are encouraging from aesthetic and clinical viewpoints. Further studies are planned to evaluate long-term results."
1292,"Short-term effectiveness of web-based guided self-help for phobic outpatients: randomized controlled trial."
1293,"BACKGROUND: Internet-based guided self-help has been successfully used in the general population, but it is unknown whether this method can be effectively used in outpatient clinics for patients waiting for face-to-face psychotherapy for phobias. OBJECTIVE: The aim was to assess the clinical effectiveness of Phobias Under Control, an Internet-based intervention based on exposure therapy with weekly guidance. METHODS: We conducted a randomized controlled trial, recruiting 212 outpatients scheduled to receive face-to-face psychotherapy for any type of phobia at an outpatient clinic. Participants suffering from at least 1 DSM-IV or ICD-10 classified phobia (social phobia, agoraphobia with or without panic disorder, and/or specific phobia as ascertained by a telephone interview at baseline) were randomly allocated to either a 5-week Internet-based guided self-help program based on exposure therapy with weekly student support followed by face-to-face psychotherapy (n=105) or a wait-list control group followed by face-to-face psychotherapy (n=107). Primary outcome was the Fear Questionnaire (FQ). Secondary outcomes were the Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI) and Center of Epidemiological Studies-Depression scale (CES-D). Assessments took place by telephone at baseline (T0) and on the Internet at posttest (T1, self-assessment at 5 weeks after baseline). Missing data at T1 were imputed. RESULTS: At posttest, analysis of covariance on the intention-to-treat sample showed significant but small effect sizes between intervention and control groups on the FQ (d=0.35, P=.02), CES-D (d=0.34, P=.03), and a nonsignificant effect size on the BAI (d=0.28. P=.05). Although initial acceptance was good, high nonresponse was observed, with 86 of 212 participants (40.5%) lost to follow-up at T1 and only 14 of 105 (13.3%) intervention participants finishing all 5 weeks. CONCLUSIONS: Phobias Under Control is modestly effective in lowering phobic and depressive symptoms in a relatively short period and may be clinically beneficial when implemented in routine outpatient practice.

1294,"The natural history of glycogen storage disease types VI and IX: Long-term outcome from the largest metabolic center in Canada."
1295,"OBJECTIVES: Glycogen storage disease (GSD) types VI and IX are caused by phosphorylase system deficiencies. To evaluate the natural history and long-term treatment outcome of the patients with GSD-VI and -IX, we performed an observational retrospective case study of 21 patients with confirmed diagnosis of GSD-VI or -IX. METHODS: All patients with GSD-VI or -IX, diagnosed at The Hospital for Sick Children, were included. Electronic and paper charts were reviewed for clinical features, biochemical investigations, molecular genetic testing, diagnostic imaging, long-term outcome and treatment by two independent research team members. All information was entered into an Excel database. RESULTS: We report on the natural history and treatment outcomes of the 21 patients with GSD-VI and -IX and 16 novel pathogenic mutations in the PHKA2, PHKB, PHKG2 and PYGL genes. We report for the first time likely liver adenoma on liver ultrasound and liver fibrosis on liver biopsy specimens in patients with GSD-VI and mild cardiomyopathy on echocardiography in patients with GSD-VI and -IXb. CONCLUSION: We recommend close monitoring in all patients with GSD-VI and -IX for the long-term liver and cardiac complications. There is a need for future studies if uncooked cornstarch and high protein diet would be able to prevent long-term complications of GSD-VI and -IX."
1296,"Peripheral antioxidant markers are associated with total hippocampal and CA3/dentate gyrus volume in MDD and healthy controls-preliminary findings."
1297,"Several psychiatric disorders, including major depressive disorder (MDD), are associated with increased blood markers of oxidative stress. The relevance of this to the oxidation-sensitive hippocampus (HC) is unknown. We investigated the relationship between peripheral oxidative stress markers and HC volume in unmedicated individuals with MDD (n=16) and healthy controls (n=19). To conserve power, our primary analysis was carried out in the combined group of subjects, and secondary analyses examined each group separately. Oxidative stress markers (oxidized glutathione (GSSG)) and antioxidants (reduced glutathione (GSH), glutathione peroxidase (Gpx), and Vitamin C) were assessed, and a ""total net antioxidant score"" was calculated. 4-T MRI estimated total HC volume and HC subfield (CA1, CA1-CA2 transition zone, subiculum and CA3/dentate gyrus [CA3&DG]) volumes. Across groups, the antioxidant score was significantly and positively correlated with total HC volume and CA3&DG subfield volume (normalized to total intracranial volume), adjusting for age and sex. Similar relationships were observed in each individual group but missed statistical significance, likely due to type II errors, with the exception of a significant correlation between the antioxidant score and CA3&DG volume in the MDD group. These preliminary data are consistent with oxidative stress being associated with smaller total HC and CA3&DG subfield volumes."
1298,"Carbetocin versus oxytocin for prevention of postpartum hemorrhage: a randomised controlled trial."
1299,"OBJECTIVE: Postpartum hemorrhage (PPH) is the leading cause of maternal death worldwide. Prophylactic uterotonics are effective in reducing PPH, and the drug of choice is oxytocin. Carbetocin, a newer analog of oxytocin, has greater biological effect and longer half-life. It is also more heat-stable than oxytocin, which is of critical importance to resource poor settings. In this study, we compare the effectiveness of carbetocin with oxytocin. STUDY DESIGN: A randomised controlled trial in a tertiary maternity hospital in Mexico. We randomised 1210 pregnant women with at least one risk factor for PPH to Carbetocin 100mcg as a single intravenous bolus compared with oxytocin 20IU as a 6-h infusion, administered immediately after childbirth. The primary outcome was PPH more than 500ml. Secondary outcomes were the volume of blood loss, severe PPH (blood loss>1000ml) and need for additional uterotonics. RESULTS: There was a reduction in PPH with carbetocin when compared with oxytocin (18.4% vs. 25.7%; RR=0.67, 95% CI: 0.54-0.83; NNT 14, 95% CI: 8-37). The mean blood loss was less with carbetocin when compared with oxytocin (366+/-SE 7.8ml vs. 400+/-SE 7.6ml, p<0.001). The incidence of severe PPH did not differ (1.3% vs. 1.6%; RR=1.15, 95% CI 0.42-3.16), but fewer participants receiving carbetocin required additional uterotonics (1.5% vs. 5.8%; adjusted RR=0.3; 95% CI 0.14-0.61). CONCLUSION: This is the largest trial comparing carbetocin with oxytocin. An updated meta-analysis, combining the results from six randomised trials, including this study, found that carbetocin was associated with a reduction of PPH compared with oxytocin."
1300,"Adverse Reactions Associated with Systemic Polymyxin Therapy."
1301,"The systemic polymyxins, colistin and polymyxin B, are increasingly used for multidrug-resistant bacterial infections and have a long history of dose-limiting toxicity. This review summarizes the most recent available information about the mechanisms, incidence, risk factors, and minimization strategies for polymyxin toxicity. Nephrotoxicity is related to polymyxin exposure with both size of dose and length of therapy associated with frequency. Newer studies have questioned conventional thinking that the relative risk of nephrotoxicity is lower for colistin than polymyxin B, especially in light of evolving dosing practices. Neurotoxicities and hypersensitivity reactions are less common than nephrotoxicity. New techniques to minimize or avoid polymyxin toxicities are now emerging including a growing interest in clinical assays for therapeutic drug monitoring and the development of novel, less toxic agents (e.g., polymyxin derivatives) for the treatment of multidrug-resistant bacterial infections."
1302,"Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress, Diabetes Mellitus, and Tissue Injury."
1303,"Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress is characterized by the accumulation of unfolded and misfolded proteins in the ER lumen. Unfolded and misfolded protein accumulation interferes with the ER function and triggers ER stress response. Thus, ER stress response, also called unfolded protein response (UPR), is an adaptive process that controls the protein amount in the ER lumen and the downstream protein demand. In normal conditions, the role of ER stress is to maintain ER homeostasis, restore ER function, and protect stressed cells from apoptosis, by coordinating gene expression, protein synthesis, and accelerating protein degradation through several molecular pathways. However, prolonged ER stress response plays a paradoxical role, which leads to cell damage, apoptosis, and concomitant tissue injuries. A number of tissue alterations are involved with diabetes mellitus progress and its comorbidities via ER stress. However, certain pharmacological agents affecting ER stress have been identified. In this review, we summarized the relationship between ER stress and insulin resistance development. Moreover, we aim to explain how ER stress influences type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) development. In addition, we reviewed the literature on ER stress and UPR in three kinds of tissue injuries induced by T2DM. Finally, a retrospective analysis of the effects of anti-diabetes medications on ER stress is presented."
1304,"Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis detected in Kihansi spray toads at a captive breeding facility (Kihansi, Tanzania)."
1305,"The chytrid fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd) is the aetiological agent of amphibian chytridiomycosis, a disease associated with global amphibian population declines. In November 2012, mass mortalities of Kihansi spray toads Nectophrynoides asperginis were observed at the Kihansi captive breeding facility, located in the Udzungwa Mountains, Tanzania. Mortalities increased rapidly, and dead toads showed typical clinical signs of chytridiomycosis, including reddening of the skin that was especially evident on the toe pads. Treatment of toads with itraconazole rapidly reduced mortalities. Dead toads (n = 49) were collected and used to perform Bd-specific polymerase chain reaction and subsequent nucleotide sequencing. All toads collected at the facility were positive for Bd. The obtained Bd 5.8S rRNA gene and flanking internal transcribed spacer regions (ITS1 and ITS2) were not 100% identical to any other Bd sequences in GenBank, but closely resembled isolates from Ecuador, Japan, USA, Brazil, Korea, and South Africa. To our knowledge, this is the first study reporting molecular characteristics of Bd isolated from the Udzungwa Mountains. Strict biosecurity measures at the breeding facility and in Kihansi spray wetlands where toads have been reintroduced have been implemented. Further studies on Bd epidemiology in the Udzungwa Mountains are recommended in order to understand its origin, prevalence, and molecular characteristics in wild amphibian populations. This will be important for conservation of several endemic amphibian species in the Udzungwa Mountains, which are part of the Eastern Arc Mountains, a global biodiversity hotspot."
1306,"Isolation of a Bohle-like iridovirus from boreal toads housed within a cosmopolitan aquarium collection."
1307,"A captive 'survival assurance' population of 56 endangered boreal toads Anaxyrus boreas boreas, housed within a cosmopolitan collection of amphibians originating from Southeast Asia and other locations, experienced high mortality (91%) in April to July 2010. Histological examination demonstrated lesions consistent with ranaviral disease, including multicentric necrosis of skin, kidney, liver, spleen, and hematopoietic tissue, vasculitis, and myriad basophilic intracytoplasmic inclusion bodies. Initial confirmation of ranavirus infection was made by Taqman real-time PCR analysis of a portion of the major capsid protein (MCP) gene and detection of iridovirus-like particles by transmission electron microscopy. Preliminary DNA sequence analysis of the MCP, DNA polymerase, and neurofilament protein (NFP) genes demonstrated highest identity with Bohle iridovirus (BIV). A virus, tentatively designated zoo ranavirus (ZRV), was subsequently isolated, and viral protein profiles, restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis, and next generation DNA sequencing were performed. Comparison of a concatenated set of 4 ZRV genes, for which BIV sequence data are available, with sequence data from representative ranaviruses confirmed that ZRV was most similar to BIV. This is the first report of a BIV-like agent outside of Australia. However, it is not clear whether ZRV is a novel North American variant of BIV or whether it was acquired by exposure to amphibians co-inhabiting the same facility and originating from different geographic locations. Lastly, several surviving toads remained PCR-positive 10 wk after the conclusion of the outbreak. This finding has implications for the management of amphibians destined for use in reintroduction programs, as their release may inadvertently lead to viral dissemination."

1309,"Epigenetic control of NRF2, a master regulator of many critical anti-oxidative stress defense genes in human prostate cancer (CaP) is unknown. Our previous animal study found decreased Nrf2 expression through promoter CpG methylation/histone modifications during CaP progression in TRAMP mice. In this study, we evaluated CpG methylation of human NRF2 promoter in 27 clinical CaP samples and in LNCaP cells using MAQMA analysis and bisulfite genomic DNA sequencing. Prostate cancer tissue microarray (TMA) containing normal and prostate cancer tissues were studied by immunohistochemistry. Luciferase reporter assay using specific human NRF2 DNA promoter segments and ChIP assay against histone modifying proteins were performed in LNCaP cells. Three specific CpG sites in the NRF2 promoter were found to be hypermethylated in clinical CaP samples (BPH<ADT-RCaP<AS-CaP). NRF2 staining in human CaP TMA showed a decreasing trend for both intensity and percentage of positive cells from normal tissues to advanced-stage CaP (Gleason score from 3-9). Reporter assays in the LNCaP cells containing these three CpG sites showed methylation inhibited transcriptional activity of the NRF2 promoter. LNCaP cells treated with 5-aza/TSA restored the expression of NRF2 and NRF2 downstream target genes, decreased expression levels of DNMT and HDAC proteins, and ChIP assays showed increased RNA Pol II and H3Ac with a concomitant decrease in H3K9me3, MBD2 and MeCP2 at CpG sites of human NRF2 promoter. Taken together, these findings suggest that epigenetic modification may contribute to the regulation of transcription activity of NRF2, which could be employed as prevention and treatment target of human CaP."

1311,"Cholecystectomy is the standard treatment for symptomatic gallstone or acute cholecystitis, and a growing number of elderly patients are undergoing resection. The aim of this study is to evaluate the clinical outcome of cholecystectomy in elderly patients. We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 337 patients with symptomatic gallstone or acute cholecystitis who underwent cholecystectomies between January 2011 and June 2013. Perioperative data were compared between octogenarians and younger patients. A subgroup undergoing cholecystectomy for acute cholecystitis (n = 146, 43.3 %) was further analyzed. The octogenarian group included 34 patients (10.1 %), while the younger patient group included 303 patients (89.9 %). The octogenarian group was associated with higher rates of comorbidities and acute cholecystitis. The octogenarian group had significantly low laparoscopic completed rates, high postoperative complication rates, and longer postoperative hospital stays. Among the acute cholecystitis group, 24 patients (16.4 %) were octogenarians and 122 patients (83.6 %) were younger patients. No significant difference was found in the morbidity and postoperative hospital stay between the two groups. Only one patient (0.3 %), an octogenarian, died of pneumonia. Cholecystectomy for symptomatic gallstone or acute cholecystitis can be safely performed even in octogenarians. However, care should be taken because they have comorbidities and limited functional reserves."
1312,"Glycosylated hemoglobin level and number of oral antidiabetic drugs predict whether or not glycemic target is achieved in insulin-requiring type 2 diabetes."
1313,"AIMS: Factors predicting success (glycosylated hemoglobin (A1C)<7%) with insulin therapy in patients with insulin-requiring type 2 diabetes need to be identified. METHODS: A retrospective, multi-center, observational study was conducted for outpatients with oral antidiabetic drug (OAD)-treated type 2 diabetes whose A1C levels remained above 7%. Patients were begun on basal insulin between January 2005 and December 2006. Biochemical variables and demographic data were collected before and after 52 weeks of insulin therapy. RESULTS: A total of 565 patients (age, 60.4+/-11.9 years; A1C levels, 10.11 +/-1.81%; duration of diabetes, 11.5+/-6.8 years) were studied. By study end, 63 patients (11.2%) had achieved the glycemic goal (A1C<7%). The glycemic goal attainment rate was only 9.1% in patients with A1C>8.8% and who were taking >2 OADs at baseline. The highest rate (32.7%) of successful glycemic control was observed in the group of patients with A1C </= 8.8% and who used </= 2 OADs at baseline. CONCLUSIONS: Insulin-naive diabetic patients with A1C>8.8%, especially those who are taking >2 OADs, have small chance to achieve good glycemic control with adding only basal insulin therapy."
1314,"Evolutionary origins of the placental expression of chromosome 19 cluster galectins and their complex dysregulation in preeclampsia."
1315,"INTRODUCTION: The dysregulation of maternal-fetal immune tolerance is one of the proposed mechanisms leading to preeclampsia. Galectins are key regulator proteins of the immune response in vertebrates and maternal-fetal immune tolerance in eutherian mammals. Previously we found that three genes in a Chr19 cluster encoding for human placental galectin-13 (PP13), galectin-14 and galectin-16 emerged during primate evolution and may confer immune tolerance to the semi-allogeneic fetus. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study involved various methodologies for gene and protein expression profiling, genomic DNA methylation analyses, functional assays on differentiating trophoblasts including gene silencing, luciferase reporter and methylation assays. These methods were applied on placental specimens, umbilical cord blood cells, primary trophoblasts and BeWo cells. Genomic DNA sequences were analyzed for transposable elements, transcription factor binding sites and evolutionary conservation. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: The villous trophoblastic expression of Chr19 cluster galectin genes is developmentally regulated by DNA methylation and induced by key transcription factors of villous placental development during trophoblast fusion and differentiation. This latter mechanism arose via the co-option of binding sites for these transcription factors through promoter evolution and the insertion of an anthropoid-specific L1PREC2 transposable element into the 5' untranslated region of an ancestral gene followed by gene duplication events. Among placental Chr19 cluster galectin genes, the expression of LGALS13 and LGALS14 is down-regulated in preterm severe preeclampsia associated with SGA. We reveal that this phenomenon is partly originated from the dysregulated expression of key transcription factors controlling trophoblastic functions and galectin gene expression. In addition, the differential DNA methylation of these genes was also observed in preterm preeclampsia irrespective of SGA. CONCLUSIONS: These findings reveal the evolutionary origins of the placental expression of Chr19 cluster galectins. The complex dysregulation of these genes in preeclampsia may alter immune tolerance mechanisms at the maternal-fetal interface."
1316,"Intermittent midline suprasternal neck mass caused by superior herniation of the thymus."
1317,"Neck masses in infants and children have a wide differential diagnosis. However, neck masses apparent only during raised intrathoracic pressure are rare with a limited number of causes, including superior herniation of the normal thymus, apical lung herniation, jugular phlebectasia and laryngocoele. These conditions can easily be differentiated from one another by imaging. We present an infant with intermittent suprasternal neck mass visible only during increased intrathoracic pressure, produced either by crying or straining. Diagnosis of superior herniation of the thymus into the neck was confirmed by ultrasonography with the characteristic sonographic appearances of the normal thymus as well as its shape, size and location. Ultrasonography should be the first imaging modality of choice. Management of superior herniation of the thymus into the neck should be conservative as the thymus naturally involutes with increasing age. Awareness of the differential diagnosis of neck swelling present only on Vasalva manoeuvre or increased intrathoracic pressure is important to prevent unnecessary tests, avoid radiation, biopsy and surgery."
1318,"School Nurses and Care Coordination for Children With Complex Needs: An Integrative Review."
1319,"Health care for students with chronic needs can be complex and specialized, resulting in fragmentation, duplication, and inefficiencies. Students who miss school due to chronic conditions lose valuable educational exposure that contributes to academic success. As health-related disabilities increase in prevalence so does the need for the coordination of care within the school and between the school and service providing agencies. This integrative literature review provides a synthesis of published evidence identifying and describing the core concepts associated with the role of school nurses in providing care coordination/case management to students with complex needs. Six core essentials of nurse-provided care coordination were identified: collaboration, communication, care planning and the nursing process, continuous coordination, clinical expertise, and complementary components. Recommendations for improving care coordination were elucidated in the review. Analysis of the literature can help assure application of best practice methods for the coordination of care for students in the school setting."
1320,"Stage 1 hybrid palliation for hypoplastic left heart syndrome-assessment of contemporary patterns of use: An analysis of The Society of Thoracic Surgeons Congenital Heart Surgery Database."
1321,"OBJECTIVE: Hybrid palliation is an alternative to Norwood stage 1 for the initial management of hypoplastic left heart syndrome. Contemporary multicenter hybrid use and institutional/patient factors associated with hybrid use relative to the Norwood have not been evaluated. We describe hybrid use in relation to institutional volume, patient factors, and short-term outcomes. METHODS: Infants aged 60 days or less listed in The Society of Thoracic Surgeons Congenital Heart Surgery Database (2010-2012) undergoing initial palliation of hypoplastic left heart syndrome were included. Annual institutional hybrid use rates were calculated: [hybrid procedures/(Norwood + hybrid + transplant procedures)]. In-hospital outcomes for primary hybrid and primary Norwood were compared and stratified by high (defined as >/=50%) versus low (defined as </=10%) institutional hybrid use. RESULTS: Of 1728 patients (100 centers), most (n = 1496, 87%) underwent an index Norwood; 232 patients (13%) underwent an index hybrid procedure. Preoperative patient risk factors were more prevalent in patients undergoing the hybrid procedure. Only 13 of 100 institutions were high hybrid users, and these tended to have lower annual hypoplastic left heart syndrome index case volume. Unadjusted in-hospital mortality was higher for the hybrid compared with the Norwood procedure (30% vs 16%; P < .001). In-hospital mortality for the hybrid procedure was not associated with hybrid use (26% among institutions with low use vs 28% among institutions with high use). However, centers with high hybrid use had higher mortality after the Norwood (43%) compared with centers with low hybrid use (16%). CONCLUSIONS: Few centers currently select the hybrid procedure for most infants with hypoplastic left heart syndrome. Although unadjusted in-hospital hybrid mortality is higher than Norwood mortality, potential risk factors are more prevalent among hybrid cases. Institutions with higher hybrid use have lower hypoplastic left heart syndrome case volume and higher Norwood mortality."

Alpha-toxin, the most potent S. aureus corneal toxin, was tested as a possible mediator of damage to the iris, and alpha-toxin anti-serum and a chemical toxin inhibitor were tested as potential pathology-reducing agents. Methods: The hemolytic activity of alpha-toxin and its inhibition by a chemical inhibitor or anti-serum were quantified in vitro. Purified alpha-toxin, heat-inactivated toxin, or alpha-toxin plus normal serum, alpha-toxin anti-serum, or the chemical inhibitor, methyl-beta-cyclodextrin-cholesterol (CD-cholesterol), was injected into the rabbit anterior chamber. Pathological changes were photographed, quantified by slit-lamp examination (SLE) scoring, and further documented by histopathological analysis. Results: At five hours post-injection, eyes injected with alpha-toxin or heat-inactivated toxin had a mean SLE score of 7.3 +/- 0.59 or 0.84 +/- 0.19, respectively. Active toxin caused moderate to severe iris edema, severe erosion of the iris, and mild to moderate fibrin accumulation in the anterior chamber. Alpha-toxin plus anti-serum or CD-cholesterol, in contrast to alpha-toxin alone, caused less iris edema and epithelium sloughing as well as significantly lower SLE scores than eyes receiving alpha-toxin alone (p </= 0.019). Conclusion: Alpha-toxin caused extensive iris damage and inflammation, and either anti-alpha-toxin anti-serum or CD-cholesterol was able to significantly reduce toxin-mediated damage and inflammation."
1324,"The presence of six potentially pathogenic viruses in pigs suffering from post-weaning multisystemic wasting syndrome."
1325,"BackgroundPorcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2) is an etiological agent of porcine circovirus diseases (PCVDs). Post-weaning multisystemic wasting syndrome (PMWS) as the most important PCVD is considered a multifactorial disease. It was demonstrated that not only PCV2 but several viruses are associated with PMWS. Studies of viral co-infections in PMWS pigs led often to controversial results. The aim of this work was to determine the presence of emerging (PRRSV), re-emerging (PTV) and newly-emerging (TTSuV1, TTSuV2, PBoV1) viruses in samples of dead pigs suffering from PMWS. The impact of vaccination against PCV2 and the influence of age on the occurrence of single and multiple viral infections in pigs were also investigated.ResultsViruses were detected by PCR, RT-PCR and real-time PCR in the pooled tissue samples (lymph nodes, liver and spleen) of pigs with PMWS (n inverted question mark= inverted question mark56) which were divided into three groups: suckling piglets, post-weaning pigs and fattening pigs. In addition, lymph node samples were collected from apparently healthy fattening pigs (n inverted question mark= inverted question mark59). The effect of vaccination against PCV2 with Ingelvac CircoFlex vaccine was also investigated. Between non-vaccinated pigs, the highest prevalence of individual viruses and multiple viral infections were found in diseased post-weaning and fattening animals with PMWS. Severe clinical disease was observed in swine co-infected with PCV2 and PRRSV. The prevalence of TTSuV1 and TTSuV2 was high in all groups of pigs and did not appear to have a significant effect on the syndrome. Simultaneous infection with TTSuV1 and PBoV1 was frequently confirmed in pigs with PMWS. No healthy pig was found to be infected with PRRSV, PTV or PBoV1. Vaccination against PCV2 did not influence the prevalence of TTSuVs, but significantly protected pigs against multiple viral infections.ConclusionsPost-weaning PMWS pigs were more often co-infected with viral pathogens than suckling or fattening pigs. Co-infection with PRRSV enforces clinical signs of PMWS, the influence of other viral co-infections is not clear. Vaccination against PCV2 significantly reduced viral co-infections in pigs."
1326,"Impact of neoadjuvant chemotherapy on axillary nodal involvement in patients with clinically node negative triple negative breast cancer."
1327,"BACKGROUND: We evaluated the impact of Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy (NAC) versus primary surgery (PS) on axillary disease burden/surgery in clinically node negative Triple Negative Breast Cancer (TNBC). METHODS: Two hundred forty-three Stage I-III TNBC patients have enrolled on an IRB approved multisite prospective registry. Clinical and treatment information was collected. RESULTS: One hundred fifty-five patients with clinically node negative TNBC were identified. 47%, 49%, and 4% of patients had T1, T2, and T3 disease, respectively. Patients underwent PS (103/155, 66%) or NAC (52/155, 34%) at the discretion of treating physicians. 17% of PS and 0% of NAC patients were node positive at surgery (P = 0.006). For T2 disease, 32% of PS and 0% of NAC patients were node positive at surgery (P = 0.001). NAC patients had a lower chance of positive SLNB (0% vs. 12%, P = 0.004) and undergoing ALND (2% vs. 22%, P = 0.001) than PS patients. CONCLUSION: In this clinically node negative TNBC cohort, all NAC-treated patients were node negative at surgery, whereas 17% of PS patients had involved axillary nodes. NAC should be considered for clinically node negative TNBC to reduce the extent of axillary surgery even if breast conservation is not planned. J. Surg. Oncol. (c) 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc."
1328,"Delineation of Stenotrophomonas maltophilia isolates from cystic fibrosis patients by fatty acid methyl ester profiles and MALDI-TOF mass spectra using hierarchical cluster analysis and principal component analysis."
1329,"Stenotrophomonas maltophilia is an opportunist multidrug resistant pathogen that causes a wide range of nosocomial infections. Various cystic fibrosis (CF) centres have reported an increasing prevalence of S. maltophilia colonisation/infection among patients with this disease. The purpose of this study was to assess specific fingerprints of S. maltophilia isolates from CF patients (n=71) by investigating the fatty acid methyl esters (FAME) through gas chromatography (GC) and high abundant proteins by Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionisation-time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS), and finally, to compare them to isolates obtained from intensive care unit (ICU) patients (n=20) and the environment (n=11). Principal component analysis of GC-FAME patterns did not reveal a clustering corresponding to distinct CF, ICU or environmental types. Based on the peak area index (PAI), it was observed that S. maltophilia isolates from CF patients produced significantly higher amount of fatty acids in comparison to ICU patients and the environmental isolates. Hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) based on the MALDI-TOF MS peak profiles of S. maltophilia revealed the presence of five large clusters, suggesting a high phenotypic diversity. Although HCA of MALDI-TOF mass spectra did not result in distinct clusters predominantly composed of CF isolates, principal component analysis (PCA) revealed the presence of a distinct cluster composed of S. maltophilia isolated from CF-patients. Our data suggest that S. maltophilia colonising CF patients tend to modify not only their fatty acid patterns, but also their protein patterns as a response to adaptation in the CF-lung unfavourable environment."
1330,"Developments in patient activation of people with chronic illness and the impact of changes in self-reported health: results of a nationwide longitudinal study in The Netherlands."
1331,"OBJECTIVE: To explore how patient activation, i.e. patients' perceived knowledge, skills and self-confidence to manage their health and healthcare, develops within chronically ill individuals over time, and to estimate the impact of self-rated health on this development. METHODS: Linear regression analyses and structural equation modeling were conducted using longitudinal data from 751 people with chronic disease(s). Patient activation was assessed by the patient activation measure; self-rated health was assessed by the SF-36 general health scale. RESULTS: Mean patient activation score at baseline was 60.6, and 18 months later 56.5. Baseline self-rated health had a positive, indirect effect on patient activation at 18 months. In addition, the change in self-rated health over one year (from baseline) was a significant predictor of patients' activation scores. CONCLUSION: Patient activation is not a stable characteristic of people who have been chronically ill for years. Within individuals both increases and decreases occur, but at group level patient activation slightly decreases over time. This may (partly) be due to the deterioration of health that many people with chronic illness experience in course of time. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: Clinical practitioners should assess the activation level of chronically ill patients regularly, especially when changes in health occur."
1332,"Risk of infection and associated influenza-like disease among abattoir workers due to two Leptospira species."
1333,"SUMMARY The aims of this study were to determine the annual incidence of infection with Leptospira interrogans serovar Pomona and/or Leptospira borgpetersenii serovar Hardjo and its association with influenza-like illness (ILI) in meat workers in New Zealand. Sera were collected twice, 50-61 weeks apart, from 592 workers at eight abattoirs slaughtering sheep (n = 4), cattle (n = 2) and deer (n = 2), and tested by the microscopic agglutination test for Hardjo and Pomona. Forty-nine (8.3%) participants either seroconverted or had at least a twofold increased serological titre against either serovar. The worker infection risk was higher in sheep abattoirs (11.9%) than in abattoirs processing deer (0%) or cattle (1.2%) (P < 0.01). The annualized risk of mild (ILI) or severe clinical disease attributable to the two Leptospira serovars was 2.7%. This study has demonstrated that meat workers are at substantial risk of infection and clinical disease, suggesting further investigation of infection sources and preventive measures are warranted."
1334,"Sleep in Mother and Child Dyads During Treatment for Pediatric Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia."
1335,"Purpose/Objectives: To compare the sleep of children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) during maintenance treatment with controls and to measure the effect on maternal sleep.Design: Comparative, descriptive.Setting: Pediatric oncology clinic and communities in Colorado.Sample: 26 dyads of mothers and children with ALL and matched controls.Methods: Mothers completed insomnia severity, mood, and stress questionnaires and wore a wrist actigraph, and mothers and children completed a seven-day sleep diary.Main Research Variables: Mother and child sleep parameters (e.g., total sleep time, sleep latency, sleep efficiency, awakenings); maternal insomnia severity, mood, and stress; child sleep habits.Findings: Mothers of children with ALL reported greater insomnia compared to controls, which was correlated with anxiety, depressive symptoms, and stress. Maternal groups did not differ on diary- and actigraph-measured sleep outcomes; both groups experienced sleep fragmentation. Children with ALL took longer to fall asleep and had more variable sleep patterns.Conclusions: Actigraph and sleep diary data indicated adequate maternal sleep duration and sleep latency. Self-reported insomnia severity in mothers of children with ALL suggested sleep fragmentation that may be undetected by these measures.Implications for Nursing: Oncology nurses are in a unique position to identify sleep problems in mothers and children with ALL, which may lead to recommendations for improved sleep and referrals for treatment."
1336,"How many different ways do patients meet the diagnostic criteria for major depressive disorder?"
1337,"There are 227 possible ways to meet the symptom criteria for major depressive disorder (MDD). However, symptom occurrence is not random, and some symptoms co-occur significantly beyond chance. This raises the questions of whether all of the theoretically possible different ways of meeting the MDD criteria actually occur in patients, and whether some combinations of criteria are much more common than others. More than 1500 patients who met DSM-IV criteria for MDD at the time of the evaluation were interviewed with semi-structured interviews. The patients met the MDD symptom criteria in 170 different ways. Put another way, one-quarter (57/227) of the criteria combinations did not occur. The most frequent combination was the presence of all 9 criteria (10.1%, n=157). Nine combinations (all 9 criteria, 3 of the 8-criterion combinations, 4 of the 7-criterion combinations, and one 6-criterion combination) were present in more than 2% of the patients, together accounting for more than 40% of the diagnoses. The polythetic definition of MDD, which requires a minimum number of criteria from a list, results in significant diagnostic heterogeneity because there are many different ways to meet criteria. While there is significant heterogeneity amongst patients meeting the MDD diagnostic criteria, a relatively small number of combinations could be considered as diagnostic prototypes as they account for more than 40% of the patients diagnosed with MDD."
1338,"Temperamental differences between adolescents and young adults with or without an eating disorder."
1339,"OBJECTIVE: There is an increasing interest into the role of temperament, and more specifically the traits Sensitivity to Punishment (SP) and Sensitivity to Reward (SR), in the occurrence of eating disorder (ED) symptoms. However, the results on this topic are inconsistent, different instruments are used to measure SP and SR and there is a lack of research on adolescents and young adults, although they form a group at risk to develop an ED. Therefore, the present objective was to study personality profiles co-occurring with specific EDs in adolescents and young adults. METHOD: The present study examined the levels of SP and SR for different ED-diagnoses, namely Anorexia Nervosa of the Restricting type (AN-R; n=41), Anorexia Nervosa of the Binge/Purge type (AN-B/P; n=20) and Bulimia Nervosa (BN; n=30), and compared these with a Healthy Control group (HC; n=292). SP and SR were measured by three different temperament questionnaires in order to rule out instrument-specific findings. Only female participants between the age of 14 and 25 years were included. RESULTS: SP was transdiagnostically increased compared to HCs, whereas SR was lower in AN-R patients compared to BN patients. These results were independent of the questionnaire being used. DISCUSSION: Further research is necessary to explain how these traits may influence specific ED-symptoms."
1340,"Preclinical endodontic training with artificial instead of extracted human teeth: Does the type of exercise have an influence on clinical endodontic outcomes?"
1341,"AIM: To evaluate whether artificial resin teeth could replace extracted human teeth in preclinical endodontic training and if this teaching approach influences the outcome of root canal treatment on patients. METHODOLOGY: In a preclinical training course, students of group 1 (n=44) performed simulated endodontic exercises on four plastic blocks and three extracted human teeth. Students of group 2 (n=45) performed their exercises on plastic blocks and artificial resin teeth (Real-T Endo, Acadental, Lenexa, KS, USA). Both groups performed their first root canal treatments on patients in the following term. Radiographs taken during root canal treatment were used for the evaluation of treatment outcome. Distances between the master cone or the root filling and the radiographic apex as well as iatrogenic errors were assessed and comparisons were made using Fischer's exact test. RESULTS: In the preclinical course root canal treatments performed by students of group 2 were more often classified as acceptable and a higher number of iatrogenic errors was observed in group 1. When root canal treatments were performed on patients for the first time, no significant difference was observed between the groups in terms of radiographic technical quality of root fillings CONCLUSIONS: The application of artificial teeth instead of extracted human teeth had no effect on the technical quality of root fillings in terms of position in relation to the root apex or the creation of aberrations.

1342,"Does lean management improve patient safety culture? An extensive evaluation of safety culture in a radiotherapy institute."
1343,"PURPOSE: The importance of a safety culture to maximize safety is no longer questioned. However, achieving sustainable culture improvements are less evident. Evidence is growing for a multifaceted approach, where multiple safety interventions are combined. Lean management is such an integral approach to improve safety, quality and efficiency and therefore, could be expected to improve the safety culture. This paper presents the effects of lean management activities on the patient safety culture in a radiotherapy institute. METHODS: Patient safety culture was evaluated over a three year period using triangulation of methodologies. Two surveys were distributed three times, workshops were performed twice, data from an incident reporting system (IRS) was monitored and results were explored using structured interviews with professionals. Averages, chi-square, logistical and multi-level regression were used for analysis. RESULTS: The workshops showed no changes in safety culture, whereas the surveys showed improvements on six out of twelve dimensions of safety climate. The intention to report incidents not reaching patient-level decreased in accordance with the decreasing number of reports in the IRS. However, the intention to take action in order to prevent future incidents improved (factorial survey presented beta: 1.19 with p: 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Due to increased problem solving and improvements in equipment, the number of incidents decreased. Although the intention to report incidents not reaching patient-level decreased, employees experienced sustained safety awareness and an increased intention to structurally improve. The patient safety culture improved due to the lean activities combined with an organizational restructure, and actual patient safety outcomes might have improved as well."

1345,"Strabismus associated with anomalous extraocular muscles is rare. We present a case of strabismus caused by an anomalous orbital structure that was histopathologically consistent with an accessory extraocular muscle rather than a fibrous band, in a patient with Gorlin syndrome (nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome), an autosomal dominant multisystem disorder related to a mutation in the patched tumor suppressor gene (PTCH). Histopathology of an anomalous orbital structure consistent with extraocular muscle has not been previously reported."
1346,"Iatrogenic inferior oblique palsy: intentional disinsertion during transcaruncular approach to orbital fracture repair."
1347,"Hypotropia following orbital fracture repair is traditionally attributed to residual tissue entrapment, scarring, direct muscle injury, or damage to the branches of the oculomotor nerve serving the inferior oblique or inferior rectus muscles. We present a case of acquired hypotropia and incyclotropia that occurred following repair of an orbital fracture involving the floor and medial wall. In order to enable adequate visualization and treatment of the combined fractures, access via a transcaruncular approach and disinsertion of the inferior oblique muscle at its origin was necessary. Whereas the possibility of inferior oblique paresis due to repair of an orbital fracture via the transcaruncular approach has received some acknowledgment, there are no prior reports in the ophthalmic literature. Strabismus surgeons should be aware of this possibility when planning surgical correction of hypotropia and incyclotropia in similar cases."
1348,"The cost-effectiveness of different strategies to evaluate optic disk drusen in children."
1349,"PURPOSE: To compare the costs of diagnostic work-up for optic disk drusen where ophthalmic ultrasound was performed prior to imaging and invasive studies with those where ophthalmic ultrasound was performed after such studies. METHODS: The medical records of patients <18 years of age evaluated at a tertiary referral center between 2007 and 2012 for ""swollen"" optic nerves were retrospectively reviewed. The main outcome measure was cost of diagnostic work-up according to Georgia Medicaid global reimbursement rates. RESULTS: A total of 46 children with a B-scan ultrasound-confirmed diagnosis of calcified optic disk drusen were included. Neuroimaging was performed in 23 patients, of whom 20 had the study prior to ophthalmic ultrasound. The mean cost of evaluations for patients undergoing ancillary testing prior to ophthalmic ultrasound was $1,173; for those undergoing ancillary testing after, $305. CONCLUSIONS: Because optic disk drusen can mimic the appearance of papilledema, it is more cost-effective to perform ophthalmic ultrasonography prior to neuroimaging, especially when the patient is asymptomatic. If ophthalmic ultrasonography confirms the presence of drusen, it is more cost-effective to reassess the clinical picture before proceeding with further tests."

1354,"Treatment of age-related distance esotropia with unilateral lateral rectus resection."
1355,"PURPOSE: To report the results of a series of patients who underwent lateral rectus resection of a single muscle using nonadjustable sutures to correct acquired concomitant esotropia (age-related distance esotropia). METHODS: The medical records of patients with symptomatic age-related distance esotropia who were treated by unilateral lateral rectus resection were retrospectively reviewed. Pre- and postoperative near and distance prism diopter measurements were compared. RESULTS: The average age of the patients was 79.8 years (range, 68-90 years). The mean lateral rectus resection was 4.9 +/- 1.3 mm. All patients had complete resolution of diplopia after surgery. Median distance esotropia measurements in primary gaze were reduced from 16.0Delta preoperatively to 0Delta postoperatively (P < 0.005) at final follow-up. Any preoperative near esotropia was also completely resolved. CONCLUSIONS: In this patient cohort, age-related distance esotropia was effectively managed solely with unilateral lateral rectus resection."
1356,"Validation of Spot screening device for amblyopia risk factors."
1357,"PURPOSE: To validate the Spot Vision Screener, a handheld digital screening device that evaluates children for amblyopia risk factors as defined by 2013 criteria of the American Association for Pediatric Ophthalmology and Strabismus (AAPOS), in the setting of a controlled pediatric ophthalmology clinic. METHODS: During a 3-month period, children 2-9 years of age were screened using Spot in a pediatric ophthalmology clinic before receiving a gold standard eye examination. Gold standard examinations were evaluated using the 2013 AAPOS Vision Screening Committee guidelines and compared with results from Spot, which were evaluated using two different manufacturer referral criteria: v1.0.3 and v1.1.51. The specificity and sensitivity for each set of referral criteria to detect both amblyopia risk factors and amblyopia were calculated. RESULTS: A total of 233 children were included. Of these, 155 were successfully screened and analyzed according to two different referral criteria. Spot screeing revealed ambyopia risk factors in 109 patients; examination confirmed amblyopia in 64. Using the original manufacturer's criteria (v1.0.3), Spot was 89% sensitive and 71% specific in detecting amblyopia risk factors. The updated referral criteria (v1.1.51) were applied to the same 155 patients, and specificity improved to 88% (P < 0.02); sensitivity remained minimally affected, at 85% (P < 0.05). Spot-v1.0.3 was 92% sensitive and 41% specific in detecting amblyopia, whereas Spot-v1.1.51 was 89% sensitive and 53% specific for detecting amblyopia. CONCLUSIONS: The Spot-v1.0.3 had high sensitivity but overreferred for suspected myopia and strabismus; Spot-v1.1.51 maintained high sensitivity and improved specificity. The original referral criteria has a high sensitivity to detect amblyopia risk factors but low specificty; v1.1.51 criteria increases specificity with minimal impact on sensitivity."
1358,"The effects of surgical factors on postoperative astigmatism in patients enrolled in the Infant Aphakia Treatment Study (IATS)."
1359,"PURPOSE: To evaluate the effect of surgical factors on postoperative astigmatism in infants undergoing cataract extraction with or without intraocular lens (IOL) implantation. METHODS: The Infant Aphakia Treatment Study is a multicenter clinical trial in which 114 infants with unilateral congenital cataracts were randomized to undergo cataract extraction with IOL placement or contact lens aphakic correction. Surgical videos were reviewed with regard to incision type and location, whether the incision was extended, the number of sutures placed, and technique of closure. Corneal astigmatism was measured using a handheld keratometer prior to surgery and at 1 year of age. RESULTS: Corneal astigmatism decreased from a mean of 1.92 D at baseline to 1.62 D at age 1 year in the contact lens group but remained almost unchanged from 2.00 D to 2.09 D in the IOL group (P = 0.023). There was no statistical difference between the amount of corneal astigmatism with regard to incision type (P = 0.214) and no increase in astigmatism with extension of the incision to facilitate IOL placement (P = 0.849) at 1 year. The number of sutures and technique of closure did not influence the amount of astigmatism at 1 year. CONCLUSIONS: At the age of 1 year following cataract extraction in infants, contact lens correction and the lack of IOL placement are associated with a significant decrease in postoperative corneal astigmatism compared to IOL placement. No other surgical factors considered in this study had a statistically significant effect on corneal astigmatism."
1360,"Effect of laser photocoagulation on plasma levels of VEGF-A, VEGFR-2, and Tie2 in infants with retinopathy of prematurity."
1361,"PURPOSE: To report the baseline plasma levels of vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF-A), soluble vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2 (sVEGFR-2) and soluble Tie2 in infants with treatment-requiring retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) and to investigate the effect of laser treatment on the plasma levels. METHODS: Blood samples were collected from infants with prethreshold type 1 ROP before, 1 day after, and 1 week after confluent laser photocoagulation. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay procedure was used to determine plasma VEGF-A, sVEGFR-2, and sTie2 levels. RESULTS: A total of 48 eyes of 30 infants were included. The mean postconceptional age at which laser photocoagulation was performed was 37.5 +/- 2.9 weeks. The mean number of laser spots applied to each eye was 1,480 +/- 420. Regression of active retinopathy occurred within 1 week of treatment in all cases. Baseline plasma VEGF-A, sVEGFR-2, and sTie2 levels did not differ between unilateral and bilateral and also zone I and zone II disease. A significantly progressive decrease was observed in plasma VEGF-A, sVEGFR-2, and sTie2 levels at 1 day and 1 week after laser photocoagulation. CONCLUSIONS: Plasma levels of VEGF-A, sVEGFR-2, and sTie2 decreased significantly in our patients after laser treatment; however, because of the variability in the measurements, further studies evaluating the clinical value of these angiogenic factors in patients with treatment-requiring ROP are necessary."

1364,"Neuronal circuitry underlying the impact of D3 receptor ligands in drug addiction."
1365,"Since the cloning of the D3 receptor in the early 1990s, there has been a great deal of interest in this receptor as a possible therapeutic target for drug addiction. The development of a D3 ligand suitable for use in humans has remained elusive, so the study of the function of the D3 receptor and its possible therapeutic efficacy has largely been restricted to animals. Pre-clinical studies have established that systemic administration of D3 ligands, particularly antagonists and partial agonists, can alter drug-seeking in animals. Despite over a decade of research, few studies have investigated the effects of intra-cerebral infusion of D3 ligands on drug-seeking. In the present review, these studies are summarized, which have largely focused on stimulus-controlled behaviors. Converging evidence from studies of D3 receptor expression, Fos and pharmacological Magnetic Resonance Imaging (phMRI) is also provided to delineate some of the D3 brain systems involved in drug-seeking and taking. The data so far indicate that different brain systems may be involved in different types of stimulus control as well as drug taking."
1366,"Early Experience with Tedizolid: Clinical Efficacy, Pharmacodynamics, and Resistance."
1367,"Antimicrobial resistance among gram-positive organisms such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) continues to limit therapeutic options. The oxazolidinones are a synthetic class of agents now commonly relied on for the treatment of serious MRSA and VRE infections. With increasing utilization of linezolid, resistant pathogens have once again begun to emerge. Tedizolid, a next-generation oxazolidinone, possesses a spectrum of activity including MRSA and VRE, with significantly enhanced potency also against linezolid-resistant strains. Preclinical and early clinical studies have reported positive results, demonstrating a favorable pharmacokinetic profile in combination with key potential safety advantages. In two phase III clinical trials, tedizolid was found noninferior to linezolid in the treatment of acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections. Investigations for treatment of ventilator-acquired and health care-associated pneumonia are currently underway. Tedizolid has been subjected to pharmacodynamics studies throughout its development that have highlighted properties unique to this agent. Considerable accumulations in epithelial lining fluid and antimicrobial activity greatly augmented by the presence of granulocytes suggest that slow but bactericidal activity may be possible in some clinical scenarios. Structural distinctions between tedizolid and linezolid suggest that tedizolid has decreased vulnerability to oxazolidinone resistance mechanisms. Tedizolid minimum inhibitory concentrations are essentially unchanged in organisms possessing the chloramphenicol-florfenicol resistance gene, a horizontally transferable linezolid resistance mechanism. Although the clinical experience with tedizolid remains limited, early data suggest a potential role in the treatment of serious infections due to multidrug-resistant gram-positive pathogens."
1368,"A large-scale immuno-epidemiological simulation of influenza A epidemics."
1369,"BACKGROUND: Agent based models (ABM) are useful to explore population-level scenarios of disease spread andcontainment, but typically characterize infected individuals using simplified models of infection andsymptoms dynamics. Adding more realistic models of individual infections and symptoms may helpto create more realistic population level epidemic dynamics. METHODS: Using an equation-based, host-level mathematical model of influenza A virus infection, we develop afunction that expresses the dependence of infectivity and symptoms of an infected individual on initialviral load, age, and viral strain phenotype. We incorporate this response function in a population-scaleagent-based model of influenza A epidemic to create a hybrid multiscale modeling framework thatreflects both population dynamics and individualized host response to infection. RESULTS: At the host level, we estimate parameter ranges using experimental data of H1N1 viral titers and symptomsmeasured in humans. By linearization of symptoms responses of the host-level model we obtaina map of the parameters of the model that characterizes clinical phenotypes of influenza infection andimmune response variability over the population. At the population-level model, we analyze the effectof individualizing viral response in agent-based model by simulating epidemics across AlleghenyCounty, Pennsylvania under both age-specific and age-independent severity assumptions. CONCLUSIONS: We present a framework for multi-scale simulations of influenza epidemics that enables the study ofpopulation-level effects of individual differences in infections and symptoms, with minimal additionalcomputational cost compared to the existing population-level simulations."
1370,"Genetic testing preferences in families containing multiple individuals with epilepsy."
1371,"OBJECTIVE: To examine genetic testing preferences in families containing multiple individuals with epilepsy. METHODS: One hundred forty-three individuals with epilepsy and 165 biologic relatives without epilepsy from families containing multiple affected individuals were surveyed using a self-administered questionnaire. Four genetic testing scenarios were presented, defined by penetrance (100% vs. 50%) and presence or absence of clinical utility. Potential predictors of genetic testing preferences were evaluated using generalized estimating equations with robust Poisson regression models. The influence of 21 potential testing motivations was also assessed. RESULTS: For the scenario with 100% penetrance and clinical utility, 85% of individuals with epilepsy and 74% of unaffected relatives responded that they would definitely or probably want genetic testing. For the scenario with 100% penetrance but without clinical utility, the proportions who responded that they would want testing were significantly lower in both affected individuals (69%) and unaffected relatives (57%). Penetrance (100% vs. 50%) was not a significant predictor of genetic testing interest. The highest-ranking motivations for genetic testing were the following: the possibility that the results could improve health or health care, the potential to know if epilepsy in the family is caused by a gene, and the possibility of changing behavior or lifestyle to prevent seizures. SIGNIFICANCE: Interest in epilepsy genetic testing may be high in affected and unaffected individuals in families containing multiple individuals with epilepsy, especially when testing has implications for improving clinical care."
1372,"Meibomian Gland Alteration in Patients with Primary Chronic Dacryocystitis: An In vivo Confocal Microscopy Study."
1373,"Abstract Purpose: To evaluate meibomian gland (MG) alterations in patients with primary chronic dacryocystitis (PCD) by in vivo confocal microscopy (IVCM), and to correlate the finding with clinical presentation. Methods: Twenty-eight eyes with the diagnosis of PCD and their contralateral unaffected eyes were studied and compared with 27 normal controls. All subjects completed an Ocular Surface Disease Index questionnaire (OSDI) and underwent slit-lamp biomicroscopy examination, tear break-up time (BUT) measurements, fluorescein staining, Schirmer test I, and an IVCM examination of the MG. IVCM parameters, including the MG acinar unit density (MGAUD), periglandular inflammatory cell density (ICD), MG acinar unit longest diameter (MGALD), and MG acinar unit shortest diameter (MGASD) and their correlation with clinical data were analyzed. Results: The mean MG expressibility scores, BUT values, and staining scores were significantly worse in eyes with PCD compared with the contralateral clinically unaffected eyes and controls (p < 0.05). A significant decrease in MGAUD was observed in PCD eyes compared with the controls and the contralateral clinically unaffected eyes. Conversely, the mean ICD and MGASD values were significantly higher in the PCD eyes. There were no significant differences in mean MGALD value between the PCD eyes and the contralateral clinically unaffected eyes. In addition, there were significant changes in the IVCM parameters in the contralateral unaffected eyes compared with the controls, including MGAUD, ICD, MGALD, and MGASD. All IVCM parameters showed a strong, significant correlation with MG dropout grades, MG expressibility, fluorescein staining scores, and OSDI values (all p < 0.05). Conclusions: Patients with unilateral PCD demonstrated significant changes in MG as compared with the contralateral clinically unaffected eyes and controls. The MG function should be closely observed in these patients."
1374,"Association between Diet and Lifestyle Habits and Irritable Bowel Syndrome: A Case-Control Study."
1375,"Background/Aims: Recent papers have highlighted the role of diet and lifestyle habits in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), but very few population-based studies have evaluated this association in developing countries. The aim of this study was to evaluate the association between diet and lifestyle habits and IBS. Methods: A food frequency and lifestyle habits questionnaire was used to record the diet and lifestyle habits of 78 IBS subjects and 79 healthy subjects. Crosstabulation analysis and logistic regression were used to reveal any association among lifestyle habits, eating habits, food consumption frequency, and other associated conditions. Results: The results from logistic regression analysis indicated that IBS was associated with irregular eating (odds ratio [OR], 3.257), physical inactivity (OR, 3.588), and good quality sleep (OR, 0.132). IBS subjects ate fruit (OR, 3.082) vegetables (OR, 3.778), and legumes (OR, 2.111) and drank tea (OR, 2.221) significantly more frequently than the control subjects. After adjusting for age and sex, irregular eating (OR, 3.963), physical inactivity (OR, 6.297), eating vegetables (OR, 7.904), legumes (OR, 2.674), drinking tea (OR, 3.421) and good quality sleep (OR, 0.054) were independent predictors of IBS. Conclusions: This study reveals a possible association between diet and lifestyle habits and IBS."
1376,"Vancomycin Nephrotoxicity: A Review."
1377,"Vancomycin earned notoriety for its tendency to cause nephrotoxicity shortly after it was introduced into practice, though the impurities responsible for historically significant rates of nephrotoxicity are of minimal concern today. Increasing usage of vancomycin has provided evidence that the drug itself can be nephrotoxic, but the exact mechanism by which this occurs has not been determined. Various studies have identified risk factors associated with development of vancomycin-associated nephrotoxicity, including total daily dose > 4 grams, trough levels > 20 mg/L, therapy exceeding 6 days, concurrent use of other nephrotoxic agents, preexisting renal disease, obesity, hypotensive episodes, and increasing severity of illness. Preventative strategies beyond risk assessment and therapeutic drug monitoring have shown little promise. Most cases of nephrotoxicity are reversible with discontinuation of vancomycin, but permanent renal damage can occur. This article is intended to serve as a practical review of vancomycin-associated nephrotoxicity, including historical context, risk factors, and common methods to evaluate and define renal dysfunction."
1378,"Knockdown of Rho-associated protein kinase 1 suppresses proliferation and invasion of glioma cells."
1379,"Rho-associated protein kinase 1 (ROCK1), a serine/threonine protein kinase, affects cell invasion and migration by changing the status of the cytoskeleton. In recent years, ROCK1 was found to be overexpressed in a variety of tumors. However, the information of ROCK1 in glioma still remains elusive. In our study, the expression of ROCK1 in glioma tissues was examined by real-time PCR and the relationship between ROCK1 expression and clinical characteristics of patients with glioma was also analyzed. With the inhibition of ROCK1 expression by RNAi, the effects of ROCK1 on biological behaviors of glioma cells including cell viability, cell cycle, and cell invasion were probed in the U251 cell line by methyl thiazolyl tetrazolium (MTT) assay, flow cytometer analysis, and Transwell invasion experiment. In addition, the effects of ROCK1 on the regulation of Ki67, cyclin D1, matrix metalloproteinases 9 (MMP9), and E-cadherin were also investigated. The results indicated that ROCK1 messenger RNA (mRNA) was increased significantly compared to that in the adjacent normal tissue (P < 0.05) and the expression level of ROCK1 mRNA in high-grade malignant glioma tissue was significantly higher than that in low-grade malignant glioma tissue (P < 0.05). MTT assay and flow cytometer analysis revealed that the cell viability and cell proliferation in the ROCK1 small interfering RNA (siRNA) transfection group were markedly lower than those in the blank or negative control group (P < 0.05), and no obvious differences were found between the blank group and negative control group. The Transwell invasion experiments showed that the invasive ability of U251 cells in the ROCK1 siRNA transfection group was obviously lower than that in the blank or negative control group (P < 0.05), and there were no visible differences between the blank group and negative control group. Western blot demonstrated that the protein levels of Ki67, cyclin D1, and MMP9 in the ROCK1 siRNA transfection group were distinctly lower than those in the blank or negative control group (P < 0.05) and that the protein level of E-cadherin displayed an opposite variation (P < 0.05). In summary, the expressions of ROCK1 in glioma tissue were visibly upregulated and the increase of ROCK1 had a positive correlation with the malignant grade of glioma. The results implied that the proliferation and metastasis of the glioma cell could be inhibited by suppressing the expression of ROCK1, and our findings would provide a new target for intervention and treatment of glioma."
1380,"RNA interference-mediated knockdown of RhoGDI2 induces the migration and invasion of human lung cancer A549 cells via activating the PI3K/Akt pathway."
1381,"Rho GDP dissociation inhibitor 2 (RhoGDI2) has been identified as a tumor suppressor gene for cellular migration and invasion. However, the underlying mechanism and effector targets of RhoGDI2 in lung cancer are still not fully understood. In this study, a vector-expressed small hairpin RNA (shRNA) of RhoGDI2 was transfected into the human lung cancer cell line A549. After the successful transfection, the down-regulation of RhoGDI2 promoted the proliferation, migration, and invasion of lung cancer cells in vitro through the increasing expression and activities of the matrix metallopeptidase 9 (MMP-9) and PI3K/Akt pathways. Transiently transfecting the small interfering RNA (siRNA) of MMP-9 into the RhoGDI2 shRNA cells reduced the MMP-9 expression. Both transfecting the siRNA and adding the MMP-9 antibody into the RhoGDI2 shRNA cells led to a decrease in the invasion and migration of the lung cancer cells. The blockade of the PI3K/Akt pathway by LY294002 resulted in abolishment of the effects of RhoGDI2 shRNA in Akt phosphorylation and MMP-9 expression. This result suggests that the down-regulated RhoGDI2 contributed to the migration and invasion of the lung cancer cell line via activating the PI3K/Akt pathway and the ensuing increase in the expression and activity of MMP-9. In conclusion, we report that the shRNA-mediated knockdown of RhoGDI2 induces the invasion and migration of lung cancer due to cross-talk with the PI3K/Akt pathway and MMP-9. Verifying the role and molecular mechanism of the participation of RhoGDI2 in the migration and invasion of lung cancer may provide a target for better treatment."
1382,"Genetic variants of chemokine CCL2 and chemokine receptor CCR2 genes and risk of prostate cancer."
1383,"Chemokines and their receptors acts as mediators of migration of immune cells to the site of inflammation and deregulated inflammatory response is associated with increased risk of cancer. We performed a case-control study to analyze the frequencies of CCL2 (I/D, rs3917887), -2518 (A > G, rs1024611), and CCR2 (G > A, rs1799864) polymorphisms for prostate cancer (PCa) risk. In this hospital-based case-control study, histologically confirmed 195 PCa patients and 250 unrelated healthy controls of similar ethnicity were genotyped by PCR-RFLP. The result showed that heterozygous ID (odds ratio (OR) = 1.71; p = 0.010) carrier genotype of CCL2 gene were at increased risk for developing PCa. Variant allele D carriers (ID + DD) demonstrated a 1.67-fold increased risk (OR = 1.67; p = 0.010), suggesting a dominant effect model involved in PCa risk. Similarly, variant allele D of CCL2 gene also had a higher risk (OR = 1.53; p = 0.040) for developing PCa. High risk to PCa was also observed with respect to diplotypes, I-G (OR = 1.83; Bonferroni corrected p value (P c) = 0.004) and D-A (OR = 2.11; P c = 0.004) of CCL2 I/D and -2518 (A > G). In association of genotypes with clinic-pathological grade of tumor, homozygous DD (OR = 7.40; P c = 0.042) and variant allele carrier ID + DD (OR = 2.42; P c = 0.036) genotypes of CCL2 gene conferred risk in high Gleason grade tumor of PCa. We observed a significantly enhanced risk for PCa due to interaction between CCL2 I/D, -2518 (A > G), and CCR2 (G > A) genotypes. However, -2518 (A > G) and CCR2 V64I (G > A) gene polymorphisms were not significantly associated with PCa risk. Our results supported that CCL2 I/D gene variant contribute to the susceptibility and clinic-pathological characteristic of PCa and could be considered as an important risk factor for this malignancy in North Indian men."
1384,"The expression profiles of microRNAs in Kaposi's sarcoma."
1385,"Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) is a multicentric angioproliferative tumor of mesenchymal origin. The molecular and biologic aspects of KS are not fully understood. MicroRNAs are non-protein-coding small RNAs in the size range 19-25 nucleotides (nt) that play important roles in biological processes, including cellular differentiation, proliferation, and death. We performed a miRNA microarray analysis by detecting six paired KS and matched adjacent healthy tissues using the 7th generation of miRCURYTM LNA Array (v.18.0) (Exiqon) containing 3100 capture probes. We selected 10 significant differentially expressed miRNAs, which were confirmed by quantitative real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) in 18 paired KS and matched adjacent healthy tissue specimens. We also investigated the associations between clinical features and miRNA expression. Among the 3100 human miRNA probes in the microarrays, we identified 170 differentially expressed miRNAs (69 upregulated and 101 downregulated miRNAs) in KS versus adjacent healthy tissues. Among the most significantly upregulated miRNAs were miR-126-3p, miR-199a-3p, miR-16-5p, and the 13 KSHV-related miRNAs. The most significantly downregulated miRNAs included miR-125b-1-3p and miR-1183. Eight upregulated miRNAs, miR-181b-5p, miR-199a-3p, miR-15a-5p, miR-126-3p, miR-1297, kshv-miR-k12-12-3p, kshv-miR-k12-1-5p, and miR-16-5p, and two downregulated miRNAs, miR-125b-1-3p and miR-1183, were confirmed by qRT-PCR in 18 paired KS samples. The qRT-PCR results for 10 miRNAs were consistent with our microarray results. The miR-125b-1-3p and miR-16-5p had statistically significant associations with HHV-8 and HIV infections in KS. The results of miRNA profiling showed that KS appears to have unique expression patterns when compared with paired adjacent healthy tissues, suggesting that deregulation of miRNAs plays an important role in the progression of KS. These differentially expressed miRNAs may provide novel diagnostic and prognostic tools."
1386,"A lentiviral sponge for miRNA-21 diminishes aerobic glycolysis in bladder cancer T24 cells via the PTEN/PI3K/AKT/mTOR axis."
1387,"Cancer cells exhibit the ability to metabolise glucose to lactate even under aerobic conditions for energy. This phenomenon is known as the Warburg effect and can be a potential target to kill cancer cells. Several studies have shown evidence for interplay between microRNAs and key metabolic enzyme effecters, which can facilitate the Warburg effect in cancer cells. In the present study, a microRNA sponge forcibly expressed using a lentiviral vector was utilised to knock down miR-21 expression in vitro. qPCR and Western blot assays were performed to evaluate the expression of a regulatory factor related to aerobic glycolysis and the signalling pathway it regulates. In bladder cancer specimens, expression levels of glycolysis-related genes [glucose transporter (GLUT)1, GLUT3, lactic dehydrogenase (LDH)A, LDHB, hexokinase (HK)1, HK2, pyruvate kinase type M (PKM) and hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha (HIF-1alpha)] were higher in tumour tissues than in adjacent tissues, suggesting the role of glycolysis in bladder cancer. miR-21 inhibition in bladder cancer cell lines resulted in reduction in tumour aerobic glycolysis. Decrease in glucose uptake and lactate production was observed upon expression of the miR-21 sponge, which promoted phosphatase and tensin homologue (PTEN) expression, decreased phosphorylated AKT and deactivated mTOR. Furthermore, messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein expression levels of glycolysis-related genes were also lower in miR-21 sponge cells compared to miR-21 control cells. Our findings suggest that miR-21 acts as a molecular switch to regulate aerobic glycolysis in bladder cancer cells via the PTEN/phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT/mTOR pathway. Blocking miR-21 function can be an effective diagnostic and therapeutic approach either by itself or in combination with existing methods to treat bladder cancer."
1388,"Parathyroid hormone 1-34 enhances extracellular matrix deposition and organization during flexor tendon repair."
1389,"Parathyroid hormone (PTH) 1-34 is known to enhance fracture healing. Tendon repair is analogous to bone healing in its dependence on the proliferation and differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells, matrix formation, and tissue remodeling.1,2,3 We hypothesized that PTH 1-34 enhances tendon healing in a flexor digitorum longus (FDL) tendon repair model. C57Bl/6J mice were treated with either intraperitoneal PTH 1-34 or vehicle-control (PBS). Tendons were harvested at 3-28 days for histology, gene expression, and biomechanical testing. The metatarsophalangeal joint range of motion was reduced 1.5-2-fold in PTH 1-34 mice compared to control mice. The gliding coefficient, a measure of adhesion formation, was 2-3.5-fold higher in PTH 1-34 mice. At 14 days post-repair, the tensile strength was twofold higher in PTH 1-34 specimens, but at 28 days there were no differences. PTH 1-34 mice had increased fibrous tissue deposition that correlated with elevated expression of collagens and fibronectin as seen on quantitative PCR. PTH 1-34 accelerated the deposition of reparative tissue but increased adhesion formation. (c) 2014 Orthopaedic Research Society. Published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J Orthop Res."
1390,"Comparing CRIB-II and SNAPPE-II as mortality predictors for very preterm infants."
1391,"AIMS: This article compares the severity of illness scoring systems clinical risk index for babies (CRIB)-II and score for neonatal acute physiology with perinatal extension (SNAPPE)-II for discriminatory ability and goodness of fit in the same cohort of babies of less than 32 weeks gestation and aims to provide validation in the Australian population. METHODS: CRIB-II and SNAPPE-II scores were collected on the same cohort of preterm infants born within a 2-year period, 2003 and 2004. The discriminatory ability of each score was assessed by the area under the receiver operator characteristic curve, and goodness of fit was assessed by the Hosmer-Lemeshow (HL) test. The outcome measure was in-hospital mortality. A multivariate logistic regression model was tested for perinatal variables that might add to the risk of in-hospital mortality. RESULTS: Data for both scores were available for 1607 infants. Both scores had good discriminatory ability (CRIB-II area under the curve 0.913, standard error (SE) 0.014; SNAPPE-II area under the curve 0.907, SE 0.012) and adequate goodness of fit (HL chi2 = 11.384, 8 degrees of freedom, P = 0.183 for CRIB-II; HL chi2 = 4.319, 7 degrees of freedom, P = 0.742 for SNAPPE-II). The multivariate model did not reveal other significant variables. CONCLUSIONS: Both severity of illness scores are ascertained during the first 12 h of life and perform similarly. Both can facilitate risk-adjusted comparisons of mortality and quality of care after the first post-natal 12 h. CRIB-II scores have the advantage of being simpler to collect and calculate."
1392,"Clinical and epidemiological analysis of keloids in Chinese patients."
1393,"Keloids are common abnormally raised fibroproliferative lesions that can occur following even minor cutaneous trauma. There are limited data on Chinese patients with keloids, and the purpose of our study was to investigate the clinical and epidemiological features of keloids in Chinese patients. Assessment was performed by unified, designed questionnaires. A total of 715 patients were enrolled and statistical analysis and heritability were performed using EPI INFO 6.0, SPSS13.0 and Falconer's method. Keloids occurred typically between the ages of 10 and 30 years, and the mean age of initial onset was 21.14 +/- 13.45 years in females and 22.55 +/- 11.36 years in males. The difference in the mean age of onset was not significant between males and females (p > 0.05). A greater severity of keloids was observed in the positive history family group than in the negative history family group, and this difference was statistically significant (chi 2 = 10.889, p < 0.05). The formation of keloids in multiple anatomical sites was found to be significant in the positive family history group. This difference was statistically significant (chi 2 = 15.47, p < 0.001). The prevalence of keloids in first-, second- and third-degree relatives of the proband with keloids was 7.62, 0.38 and 0.035 %, respectively. These results were higher than those in controls and the difference of the prevalence rates of first- and second-degree relatives between probands and controls was significant (chi 2 = 224.63 and 12.078, respectively, p < 0.001). The heritability of keloids in first-, second- and third-degree relatives was 72.45, 40.55 and 17.07 %, respectively. Our findings revealed that the most severe forms of keloids were observed in the probands with positive family history, and the heritability in first-degree relatives of probands was 72.45 %. It is certain, therefore, that genetic factors play a role in the hereditary composition of keloids."
1394,"Association between predonation serum uric acid concentration and change in renal function after living kidney donation in women."
1395,"BACKGROUND: Reduction in renal mass after unilateral nephrectomy causes functional and structural changes in the remaining kidney. We investigated the association between predonation serum uric acid (SUA) concentration and the change in renal function after living kidney donation. METHODS: This retrospective study included 413 living kidney donors from a single center. We collected medical history and laboratory findings at baseline and 6 months after donation. Renal function was assessed by calculating the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) using the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration equation. Main outcomes were the percentage change in eGFR from before to 6 months after donation and the percentage of patients whose eGFR decreased by >25% after donation compared with the predonation baseline value. RESULTS: Mean age was 40 +/- 11 years, and eGFR was 106 +/- 14 ml/min/1.73 m2 . In women, the SUA concentration was linearly associated with the change in eGFR after donation independently of baseline eGFR (standardized coefficient - 0.16, P = 0.04). Multiple logistic analysis showed that a 59.5 mumol/l increase in baseline SUA concentration was associated with a 1.7-fold higher risk of a >25% decrease in eGFR after donor nephrectomy [95% confidence interval, 1.2-2.5; P = 0.007] in women. In contrast, SUA concentration was not an independent risk factor of decrease in eGFR after donor nephrectomy in men. CONCLUSIONS: Predonation SUA concentration is associated independently with the change in renal function after donor nephrectomy in women but not in men."
1396,"Predictors of hospital admission after ED observation unit care."
1397,"BACKGROUND: Emergency department observation units (EDOUs) represent an opportunity to efficiently manage patients with common conditions requiring short-term hospital care. Understanding which patients are ultimately admitted to the hospital after care in an EDOU may enhance patient selection for EDOU care. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective analysis of US emergency department visits resulting in admission to observation status using the National Hospital Ambulatory Care Survey (NHAMCS) from 2009 to 2010, a nationally representative sample. We used survey-weighted logistic regression to identify predictors at the patient level, visit level, and hospital level for inpatient hospital admission after EDOU care. RESULTS: Between 2009 and 2010, there were 4.65 million patient visits (95% confidence interval [CI], 3.68-5.63) to EDOUs in the United States. Of those evaluated in an EDOU, 40.4% (95% CI, 34.5%-46.6%) were admitted to the hospital after EDOU care. Progressively older patient age was a strong predictor of hospital admission: patients age older than 65 years were more than 5 times more likely to be admitted than patients age younger than 18 years (odds ratio, 5.36; 95% CI, 2.26-12.73). The only other visit-level factor associated with admission was a reason for visit of chest pain; this was associated with a lower rate of hospital admission (odds ratio, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.41-0.91). CONCLUSION: Across the United States in 2009 to 2010, older patient age was a strong predictor of admission after EDOU care, suggesting that older patients are more likely to require inpatient hospital services after EDOU care than younger patients."
1398,"Cardiac myxoma as a mimic: a diagnostic challenge."
1399,"OBJECTIVE: Patients with occult, undiagnosed cardiac myxomas (CM) often present with acute complications that mimic other, more common, conditions. We describe two recently encountered patients who classically demonstrate this phenomenon and report the results of an integrative review of CM cases to define the characteristics of such patients. METHODS: A comprehensive 20-year review of reported cases that described patient-specific data of CM was performed. Using a standardized tool, the following elements were collected: age; gender; presenting symptoms and signs; diagnostic and management approaches; and outcomes. RESULTS: One hundred twenty-six cases of CM were identified. The mean patient age was 47.5 years (range, 6-90). Seventy (56%) were women. The most common mimic conditions initially being considered were cardiac complications, including acutely decompensated heart failure, myocardial infarction, dysrhythmia and sudden death (46%); systemic embolization, including cutaneous infarction and pulmonary embolism (23%); central nervous system embolization, including transient ischemic attack and acute stroke syndrome (22%); and constitutional conditions, such as fever, myalgia, arthralgia, fatigue, and myxoma infections (17%). Echocardiography proved to be a readily available and accurate diagnostic test. The majority of reported patients experienced full recoveries after surgical intervention. CONCLUSIONS: CM is a rare but potentially life-threatening condition. Symptoms and signs relating to CM mimic other, more common conditions, resulting in diagnostic delay. Echocardiography can quickly and accurately diagnose CM and timely surgical intervention is curative. Clinician awareness of this condition, in a suggestive clinical context, will increase the likelihood of optimal patient outcome."
1400,"A Caulobacter MreB mutant with irregular cell shape exhibits compensatory widening to maintain a preferred surface area to volume ratio."
1401,"Rod-shaped bacteria typically elongate at a uniform width. To investigate the genetic and physiological determinants involved in this process, we studied a mutation in the morphogenetic protein MreB in Caulobacter crescentus that gives rise to cells with a variable-width phenotype, where cells have regions that are both thinner and wider than wild-type. During growth, individual cells develop a balance of wide and thin regions, and mutant MreB dynamically localizes to poles and thin regions. Surprisingly, the surface area to volume ratio of these irregularly-shaped cells is, on average, very similar to wild-type. We propose that, while mutant MreB localizes to thin regions and promotes rod-like growth there, wide regions develop as a compensatory mechanism, allowing cells to maintain a wild-type-like surface area to volume ratio. To support this model, we have shown that cell widening is abrogated in growth conditions that promote higher surface area to volume ratios, and we have observed individual cells with high ratios return to wild-type levels over several hours by developing wide regions, suggesting that compensation can take place at the level of individual cells."
1402,"Treatment of pseudoepitheliomatous, keratotic, and micaceous balanitis with topical photodynamic therapy."
1403,"BACKGROUND: Pseudoepitheliomatous, keratotic, and micaceous balanitis (PKMB) is an extremely rare condition occurring over the glans in older men who undergo circumcision late in life. Its exact etiology is unknown. OBJECTIVES: We report a patient with PKMB that involved the meatus and led to urinary obstruction. METHODS: A 57-year-old, circumcised man presented with partial urinary obstruction caused by a thick, nail-like covering on the skin of his glans penis. Based on histology, PKMB was diagnosed. There was no cytological atypia. The patient was treated successfully with topical 5-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) photodynamic therapy (PDT). RESULTS: There was no recurrence after 18 months of follow-up. Treatment with ALA-PDT seems to be effective and well tolerated in PKMB. CONCLUSIONS: This case indicates that ALA-PDT may be an effective treatment option for plaque-stage PKMB and thus warrants further investigation."
1404,"Influence of detomidine on atrial fibrillation cycle length measured by intracardiac electrogram recording and by colour tissue Doppler imaging in horses."
1405,"REASONS FOR PERFORMING STUDY: Shortening of atrial fibrillation cycle length (AFCL) is a marker of atrial electrical remodelling due to atrial fibrillation (AF). OBJECTIVES: To investigate the effect of detomidine administration on AFCL measured invasively from an intra-atrial electrogram (AFCLEGM) and non-invasively by tissue Doppler imaging (AFCLTDI). We hypothesised that detomidine would have no effect on AFCL but would improve the ease of TDI measurements and facilitate non-invasive AFCL determination. STUDY DESIGN: Prospective clinical study. METHODS: Measurements were performed before and after intravenous administration of 7.5 mug/kg detomidine in 33 episodes of AF in 32 horses (582 +/- 64 kg, 10 +/- 3 years) referred for electrical cardioversion. AFCLEGM was measured from a right atrial intra-cardiac electrogram. AFCLTDI was measured from atrial colour tissue velocity curves in 5 atrial wall regions. Mean AFCLEGM and AFCLTDI without and with sedation were compared using a repeated measures linear mixed model with Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons and calculation of the Bland-Altman mean bias and limits of agreement between AFCLEGM and AFCLTDI . RESULTS: The mean AFCL was significantly increased after sedation, however, this increase was very small (mean difference +4 ms). For AFCLTDI measurements, sedation significantly improved the quality of the atrial myocardial velocity curves and the number of AF cycles that could be measured per cardiac cycle. The Bland-Altman bias between AFCLEGM without sedation and AFCLTDI with sedation ranged from -18 ms to +15 ms depending on wall region. Bland-Altman limits of agreement were similar between AFCLEGM without sedation and AFCLTDI without and with sedation. Therefore, non-invasive AFCLTDI measurements with sedation can be used to estimate the atrial fibrillatory rate. CONCLUSIONS: Sedation facilitates non-invasive AFCL measurements but causes a slight increase in AFCL. Non-invasive AFCL measurements can be used as an indicator of atrial electrical remodelling, to study AF pathophysiology and to investigate the effect of anti-arrhythmic drugs."
1406,"Clinical manifestations and radiological features may contribute to the early diagnosis of radiation-induced sarcoma after breast cancer."
1407,"AIM: To describe the clinical manifestations and radiological features contributing to the early diagnosis of radiation-induced sarcoma (RIS) after radiotherapy for breast cancer. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective analysis included four typical cases of RIS diagnosed at Affiliated Hospital of Academy of Military Medical Sciences between 1980 and 2013. Patient and imaging characteristics, treatment modalities, and outcomes were extracted from patients' medical records. Two pathologists reviewed all histological slides. RESULTS: All four cases were misdiagnosed and treated for several months as cases of breast cancer relapse. CT using the bone-window setting and three-dimensional reconstructions clearly displayed bone tumours of RIS in three cases. Skin alterations were observed in all cases. At the time of RIS diagnosis, three patients were free of breast cancer. In one patient with bilateral breast cancer and lung metastasis, chemotherapy resulted in complete remission of the metastasis, but RIS progression. No RIS in this series responded to chemotherapy or endocrine therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Abnormalities appearing in the radiation field long after RT should alert clinicians to the potential development of RIS. Careful physical examination and follow-up imaging studies are necessary. The presence of skin alterations, bone tumours at CT or radiography, and poor response to anti-cancer drugs may contribute to the early detection of RIS. Biopsy should be performed immediately when RIS is suspected."
1408,"Growth hormone deficiency after mild combat-related traumatic brain injury."
1409,"OBJECTIVE: Traumatic brain injury (TBI) has been recognized as a cause of growth hormone deficiency (GHD) in civilians. However, comparable data are sparse in veterans who incurred TBI during combat. Our objective was to determine the prevalence of GHD in veterans with a history of combat-related TBI, and its association with cognitive and psychosocial dysfunction. DESIGN: Single center prospective study. PATIENTS: Twenty male veterans with mild TBI incurred during combat 8-72 months prior to enrollment. MEASUREMENTS: GHD was defined by a GH peak <3 mug/L during glucagon stimulation test. Differences in neuropsychological, emotional, and quality of life of the GHD Veterans were described using Cohen's d. Large effect sizes were considered meaningful. RESULTS: Mean age was 33.7 years (SD 7.8) and all subjects had normal thyroid hormone and cortisol levels. Five (25 %) exhibited a subnormal response to glucagon. Sixteen participants (80 %) provided sufficient effort for valid neuropsychological assessment (12 GH-sufficient, 4 GHD). There were large effect size differences in self-monitoring during memory testing (d = 1.46) and inhibitory control (d = 0.92), with worse performances in the GHD group. While fatigue and post-traumatic stress disorder were comparable, the GHD group reported more depression (d = 0.80) and lower quality of life (d = 0.64). CONCLUSIONS: Our study found a 25 % prevalence of GHD in veterans with mild TBI as shown by glucagon stimulation. The neuropsychological findings raise the possibility that GHD has adverse effects on executive abilities and mood. Further studies are needed to determine whether GH replacement is an effective treatment in these patients."
1410,"A further assessment of decision-making in anorexia nervosa."
1411,"OBJECTIVE: Anorexia nervosa (AN) may be associated with impaired decision-making. Cognitive processes underlying this impairment remain unclear, mainly because previous assessments of this complex cognitive function were completed with a single test. Furthermore, clinical features such as mood status may impact this association. We aim to further explore the hypothesis of altered decision-making in AN. METHOD: Sixty-three adult women with AN and 49 female controls completed a clinical assessment and were assessed by three tasks related to decision-making [Iowa Gambling Task (IGT), Balloon Analogue Risk Task (BART), Probabilistic Reversal Learning Task (PRLT)]. RESULTS: People with AN had poorer performance on the IGT and made less risky choices on the BART, whereas performances were not different on PRLT. Notably, AN patients with a current major depressive disorder showed similar performance to those with no current major depressive disorder. CONCLUSION: These results tend to confirm an impaired decision making-process in people with AN and suggest that various cognitive processes such as inhibition to risk-taking or intolerance of uncertainty may underlie this condition Furthermore, these impairments seem unrelated to the potential co-occurent major depressive disorders."
1412,"Relevance of Campylobacter to public health-The need for a One Health approach."
1413,"Campylobacter species belong to the most important foodborne bacteria which cause gastroenteritis in humans in both developed and developing countries. With increasing reporting rates, the public awareness towards Campylobacter infections is growing continuously. This strengthens the necessity to establish intervention measures for prevention and control of thermophilic Campylobacter spp. along the food chain, as in particular poultry and poultry meat represent a major source of human infections. An interdisciplinary One Health approach and a combined effort of all stakeholders are necessary to ultimately reduce the burden of campylobacteriosis cases in humans. Numerous studies point out, however, that at present a complete elimination of Campylobacter in the food chain is not feasible. The present aim should therefore be to establish control measures and intervention strategies to minimize the occurrence of Campylobacter spp. in livestock (e.g. poultry flocks) and to reduce the quantitative Campylobacter burden in animals and foods. To this end, a combination of intervention methods at different stages of the food chain appears most promising. That has to be accompanied by targeted consumer advice and education campaigns to raise the awareness towards Campylobacter infections."
1414,"Versatile carboxymethyl chitin and chitosan nanomaterials: a review."
1415,"Biocompatibility, biodegradability, and low cost of chitin and chitosan have drawn immense attention in many fields including medicine, bioinspired material science, pharmaceuticals, and agriculture. Their handling and processing are difficult owing to its insolubility in neutral aqueous solution or organic solvents. One of the methods used to improve the solubility characteristics of chitin and chitosan is chemical modification. Introducing a carboxymethyl group is the most advantageous method of increasing the solubility of chitosan at neutral and alkaline pH. Carboxymethyl chitin (CMC) and carboxymethyl chitosan (CMCS) are water soluble derivatives formed by introducing CH2 COOH function into the polymer which endows it with better biological properties. The functional group makes CMC/CMCS nanoparticles (NPs) efficient vehicles for the delivery of DNA, proteins, and drugs. This review provides an overview of the characteristics of CMC/CMCS NPs as well as fulfills the task of describing and discussing its important roles primarily in cancer nanomedicine detailing the targeted drug delivery aspect. The application of these NPs in imaging, agriculture, and textiles has also been highlighted. The review also elaborates the advantages of using the CMC and CMCS NPs for drug and gene delivery.

1416,"Comprehensive genomic profiling of pancreatic acinar cell carcinomas identifies recurrent RAF fusions and frequent inactivation of DNA repair genes."
1417,"Pancreatic acinar cell carcinomas (PACCs) account for ~1% (~500 cases) of pancreatic cancer diagnoses annually in the United States. Oncogenic therapuetic targets have proven elusive in this disease, and chemotherapy and radiation have demonstrated limited efficacy against these tumors. Comprehensive genomic profiling of a large series of PACCs (n=44) identified recurrent rearrangements involving BRAF and RAF1 (CRAF) in ~23% of tumors. The most prevalent fusion, SND1-BRAF, results in activation of the mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway which can be abrogated with MEK inhibition. SND1-BRAF transformed cells were sensitive to treatment with the MEK inhibitor, trametinib. PACCs lacking RAF rearrangements were significantly enriched for genomic alterations (GAs) causing inactivation of DNA repair genes (45%); these GAs have been associated with sensitivity to platinum-based therapies and PARP inhibitors. Collectively, these results identify potentially actionable GAs in the majority of PACCs, and provide a rationale for using personalized therapies in this disease."

1420,"Quantification of BRAF V600E alleles predicts papillary thyroid cancer progression."
1421,"The BRAF V600E mutation is the most common genetic alteration in thyroid cancer. However, its clinicopathological significance and clonal mutation frequency remain unclear. To clarify the inconsistent results, we investigated the association between the allelic frequency of BRAF V600E and the clinicopathological features of classic papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC). Tumour tissues from two independent sets of patients with classic PTC were manually microdissected and analysed for the presence or absence of the BRAF mutation and the mutant allelic frequency using quantitative pyrosequencing. For external validation, the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) data were analysed. The BRAF V600E mutation was found in 264 (82.2%) of 321 classic PTCs in the training set. The presence of BRAF V600E was only associated with extrathyroidal extension and the absence of thyroiditis. In BRAF V600E-positive tumours, the mutant allelic frequency varied from 8% to 41% of the total BRAF alleles (median, 20%) and directly correlated with tumour size and the number of metastatic lymph nodes. Lymph node metastases were more frequent in PTCs with a high (>/=20%) abundance of mutant alleles than in those with a low abundance of mutant alleles (P=0.010). These results were reinforced by validation dataset (n=348) analysis but were not reproduced in the TCGA dataset. In a population with prevalent BRAF mutations, quantitative analysis of the BRAF mutation could provide additional information regarding tumour behaviour, which is not reflected by qualitative analysis. Nonetheless, prospective studies are needed before the mutated allele percentage can be considered as a prognostic factor."
1422,"Continuous EEG monitoring: A survey of neurophysiologists and neurointensivists."
1423,"OBJECTIVE: Continuous EEG monitoring (cEEG) of critically ill adults is being used with increasing frequency, and practice guidelines on indications for cEEG monitoring have recently been published. However, data describing the current practice of cEEG in critically ill adults is limited. We aimed to describe the current practice of cEEG monitoring in adults in the United States. METHODS: A survey assessing cEEG indications and procedures was sent to one intensivist and one neurophysiologist responsible for intensive care unit (ICU) cEEG at 151 institutions in the United States. At some institutions only one physician could be identified. RESULTS: One hundred thirty-seven physicians from 97 institutions completed the survey. Continuous EEG is utilized by nearly all respondents to detect nonconvulsive seizures (NCS) in patients with altered mental status following clinical seizures, intra cerebral hemorrhage (ICH), traumatic brain injury, and cardiac arrest, as well as to characterize abnormal movements suspected to be seizures. The majority of physicians monitor comatose patients for 24-48 h. In an ideal situation with unlimited resources, 18% of respondents would increase cEEG duration. Eighty-six percent of institutions have an on-call EEG technologist available 24/7 for new patient hookups, but only 26% have technologists available 24/7 in-house. There is substantial variability in who reviews EEG and how frequently it is reviewed as well as use of quantitative EEG. SIGNIFICANCE: Although there is general agreement regarding the indications for ICU cEEG, there is substantial interinstitutional variability in how the procedure is performed."
1424,"Mutual Exclusivity of Hyaluronan and Hyaluronidase in Invasive Group A Streptococcus."
1425,"A recent analysis of group A Streptococcus (GAS) invasive infections in Australia has shown a predominance of M4 GAS, a serotype recently reported to lack the antiphagocytic hyaluronic acid (HA) capsule. Here, we use molecular genetics and bioinformatics techniques to characterize 17 clinical M4 isolates associated with invasive disease in children during this recent epidemiology. All M4 isolates lacked HA capsule, and whole genome sequence analysis of two isolates revealed the complete absence of the hasABC capsule biosynthesis operon. Conversely, M4 isolates possess a functional HA-degrading hyaluronate lyase (HylA) enzyme that is rendered nonfunctional in other GAS through a point mutation. Transformation with a plasmid expressing hasABC restored partial encapsulation in wild-type (WT) M4 GAS, and full encapsulation in an isogenic M4 mutant lacking HylA. However, partial encapsulation reduced binding to human complement regulatory protein C4BP, did not enhance survival in whole human blood, and did not increase virulence of WT M4 GAS in a mouse model of systemic infection. Bioinformatics analysis found no hasABC homologs in closely related species, suggesting that this operon was a recent acquisition. These data showcase a mutually exclusive interaction of HA capsule and active HylA among strains of this leading human pathogen."
1426,"Structure and mechanism of cysteine peptidase Kgp, a major virulence factor of Porphyromonas gingivalis in periodontitis."
1427,"Cysteine peptidases are key proteolytic virulence factors of the periodontopathogen Porphyromonas gingivalis, which causes chronic periodontitis, the most prevalent dysbiosis-driven disease in humans. Two peptidases, gingipain K (Kgp) and R (RgpA and RgpB), which differ in their selectivity after lysines and arginines, respectively, collectively account for 85% of the extracellular proteolytic activity of P. gingivalis at the site of infection. Therefore, they are promising targets for the design of specific inhibitors. While the structure of mature RgpB is known, little is known about Kgp, which shares only 27% sequence identity. We report the high-resolution crystal structure of a competent fragment of Kgp encompassing the catalytic cysteine peptidase domain and a downstream immunoglobulin superfamily-like domain, which is required for folding and secretion of Kgp in vivo. The structure, which strikingly resembles a tooth, was serendipitously trapped with a fragment of a covalent inhibitor targeting the catalytic cysteine. This provided accurate insight into the active site and suggested that catalysis may require a catalytic triad, C477-H444-D388, rather than the cysteine-histidine dyad normally found in cysteine peptidases. In addition, a 20A-long solvent-filled interior channel traverses the molecule and links the bottom of the specificity pocket with the molecular surface opposite the active-site cleft. This channel, absent in RgpB, may enhance the plasticity of the enzyme, which would explain the much lower activity in vitro towards comparable specific synthetic substrates. Overall, the present results report the architecture and molecular determinants of the working mechanism of Kgp, including interaction with its substrates."
1428,"Epithelial TRPV1 Signaling Accelerates Gingival Epithelial Cell Proliferation."
1429,"Transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily V member 1 (TRPV1), a member of the calcium-permeable thermosensitive transient receptor potential superfamily, is a sensor of thermal and chemical stimuli. TRPV1 is activated by noxious heat (> 43 degrees C), acidic conditions (pH < 6.6), capsaicin, and endovanilloids. This pain receptor was discovered on nociceptive fibers in the peripheral nervous system. TRPV1 was recently found to be expressed by non-neuronal cells, such as epithelial cells. The oral gingival epithelium is exposed to multiple noxious stimuli, including heat and acids derived from endogenous and exogenous substances; however, whether gingival epithelial cells (GECs) express TRPV1 is unknown. We show that both TRPV1 mRNA and protein are expressed by GECs. Capsaicin, a TRPV1 agonist, elevated intracellular Ca2+ levels in the gingival epithelial cell line, epi 4. Moreover, TRPV1 activation in epi 4 cells accelerated proliferation. These responses to capsaicin were inhibited by a specific TRPV1 antagonist, SB-366791. We also observed GEC proliferation in capsaicin-treated mice in vivo. No effects were observed on GEC apoptosis by epithelial TRPV1 signaling. To examine the molecular mechanisms underlying this proliferative effect, we performed complementary (c)DNA microarray analysis of capsaicin-stimulated epi 4 cells. Compared with control conditions, 227 genes were up-regulated and 232 genes were down-regulated following capsaicin stimulation. Several proliferation-related genes were validated by independent experiments. Among them, fibroblast growth factor-17 and neuregulin 2 were significantly up-regulated in capsaicin-treated epi 4 cells. Our results suggest that functional TRPV1 is expressed by GECs and contributes to the regulation of cell proliferation."
1430,"Effects of donepezil, an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, on neurogenesis in a rat model of vascular dementia."
1431,"Vascular dementia (VaD) is the second most common form of dementia caused by cerebrovascular disease. Several recent reports demonstrated that cholinergic deficits are implicated in the pathogenesis of VaD and that cholinergic therapies have shown improvement of cognitive function in patients with VaD. However, the precise mechanisms by which donepezil achieves its effects on VaD are not fully understood. Donepezil hydrochloride is an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor (AChEI) currently used for the symptomatic treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Several lines of evidence have demonstrated that AChEIs such as donepezil promote neurogenesis in the central nervous system. We investigated whether donepezil regulated hippocampal neurogenesis after bilateral common carotid artery occlusion (BCCAO) in rats, a commonly used animal model of VaD. To evaluate the effect of donepezil on neurogenesis, we orally treated rats with donepezil (10mg/kg) once a day for 3weeks, and injected BrdU over the same 3-week period to label newborn cells. The doses of donepezil that we used have been reported to activate cholinergic activity in rats. After 3weeks, a water maze task was performed on these rats to test spatial learning, and a subsequent histopathological evaluation was conducted. Donepezil improved memory impairment and increased the number of BrdU-positive cells in the dentate gyrus (DG) of BCCAO animals. These results indicated that donepezil improves cognitive function and enhances the survival of newborn neurons in the DG in our animal model of VaD, possibly by enhancing the expression of choline acetyltransferase and brain-derived neurotropic factor."
1432,"Free multilobed posterior interosseous artery perforator flap for multi-finger skin defect reconstruction."
1433,"BACKGROUND: The posterior interosseous artery (PIA) perforator flap can be used for reconstruction of soft-tissue defects of fingers. Based on the multiple perforators from the posterior interosseous artery, we describe a technique to reconstruct the multi-finger defect in the use of the free multilobed PIA perforator flap. METHODS: PIA perforators from different areas of the forearm were used to design a free multilobed skin paddle for multi-finger skin defect reconstruction. Each paddle without the deep fascia had separate perforators. To increase the perforator pedicle length, the courses of the PIA perforators were dissected from the superficial layer of the deep fascia to the subcutaneous layer. RESULTS: The flap was raised as a unilateral free bilobed PIA perforator flap in 10 cases of two-finger defects, a free trilobed PIA perforator flap in two cases of three-finger defects, and a bilateral free bilobed PIA perforator flap in one case of four-finger defects. The average effective vascular pedicle length and trunk pedicle length were 8.3 and 3.1 cm, respectively, for the bilobed flap, and 6.3 and 4.0 cm, respectively, for the trilobed flap. All flaps survived except one paddle with tip necrosis. At 10.8 months (range, 4-27 months) after surgery, 10 cases showed satisfactory cosmetic appearance, while the fingers were bulky in the remaining three cases. The average score of static two-point discrimination in 10 innervated paddles was 12.9 mm. The remaining 20 paddles recovered only protective sensation. The average total active motion (TAM) of each finger was 164 degrees before surgery and 187 degrees at the latest follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: Free multilobed PIA perforator flap is a good candidate for reconstruction of multi-finger skin defect. Clinical question/level of evidence: Therapeutic, ."
1434,"CD146 as a new marker for an increased chondroprogenitor cell sub-population in the later stages of osteoarthritis."
1435,"Cartilage-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have been isolated with different methods. In this study lateral and medial femoral condyles were respectively collected from patients with late-stage osteoarthritis during the total knee arthroplasty. After digestion of the cartilage tissues with type II collagenase and analysis by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) with CD146, a chondroprogenitor cell sub-population were isolated and purified. The expression of other MSC-associated markers in the CD146+ chondroprogenitors was analyzed by flow cytometry. Multi-lineage differentiation capacity of CD146+ chondroprogenitors was compared with that of unsorted chondrocytes and adipose-derived MSCs (ADMSCs). Higher percentage of CD146+ chondroprogenitors isolated from the medial femoral condyles was observed than that from the lateral. CD146+ chondroprogenitors expressed high levels of MSC-specific surface antigens, and showed higher chondrogenesis capacity than ADMSCs and unsorted chondrocytes in a 3D cell pellet culture model. Thus CD146 might be a new cell surface marker for cartilage progenitor cell population in the late-stage osteoarthritis. (c) 2014 Orthopaedic Research Society. Published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

1436,"Mediating effects of social support and self-concept on depressive symptoms in adults with spinal cord injury."
1437,"Study design:Cross-sectional, correlational design.Objectives:To examine the effects of individual demographics, activities of daily living, social support, and self-concept on depressive symptoms in people with spinal cord injury (SCI).Setting:A convenience sample of 135 adults with SCI was recruited from medical and rehabilitation centres in Taiwan.Methods:Face-to-face, structured interviews were employed to collect information. Study questionnaires included a demographic sheet, the Barthel scale, the modified Social Support Inventory, the Huang self-concept scale and the Beck Depression Inventory. Data were analysed by structural equation modelling (SEM).Results:The average age of the participants was 43.3 years (+/-11.98), the mean duration of injury was 114 months (+/-93.78), and most were males. Emotional support (r=-0.173, P<0.05) and appraisal support (r=-0.261, P<0.01) were negatively correlated with depressive symptoms. The best fitted SEM model included individual demographics and physical function, social support and self-concept as significant predictors of depressive symptoms, with self-concept acting as a mediator in this relationship. Participants' characteristics and social support both contributed substantial indirect effects on depressive symptoms via self-concept. Self-concept also mediated the relationship between education, income, physical functioning and participants' depressive symptoms.Conclusion:For this sample, the more negative that individuals perceived themselves, the more likely they were to report worsening depressive symptoms. The more social support that individuals have, the more likely they were to report less depressive symptoms. Further longitudinal research will help clarify the direction of these relationships.Spinal Cord advance online publication, 30 September 2014; doi:10.1038/sc.2014.158."
1438,"Knowledge, attitudes and practices of medical staff towards obesity management in patients with spinal cord injuries: an International survey of four western European countries."
1439,"Objective:To (1) examine the opinions of medical staff working in spinal cord injury (SCI) centres (SCICs); (2) evaluate their knowledge, attitudes and practices towards obesity prevention and management; (3) report the number of beds and dietitians available at each SCIC.Methods:A 37-item questionnaire was sent to 23 SCICs in the UK, the Netherlands, Belgium and the Republic of Ireland between September 2012 and January 2013.Results:Eighteen SCICs returned the questionnaires for analysis. All respondents stated that they had an interest in obesity treatment but only 2.3% of the respondents received training in obesity management. Sixty-one percent of staff did not consider body mass index (BMI) to be appropriate for use in SCI patients and subsequently less than half of the respondents use BMI routinely. The majority of respondents reported that they are confident in dealing with overweight (74.5%) and obese (66.1%) SCI adults, less than half (44.1%) are confident in treating overweight and obese SCI children. Respondents also indicated the need for nationally adopted guidelines and a lack of physical activity provision. There were 17.5 whole-time equivalent (WTE) dietitians recorded in 22 SCICs, equivalent to 47.8 beds per WTE dietitians (range 10-420). Non-UK SCIC dietitians are significantly better resourced than in UK SCICs (beds per WTE dietitian: 36 vs 124, P=0.035).Conclusion:Medical staff expressed the need to participate in obesity prevention and management. Appropriate training should be considered for all medical staff and the development of specific weight management guidelines and dietetic provision should be considered.Spinal Cord advance online publication, 30 September 2014; doi:10.1038/sc.2014.168."
1440,"Associations between abdominal visceral fat and surrogate measures of obesity in Japanese men with spinal cord injury."
1441,"Study design:Cross-sectional study.Objectives:There are ethnic differences in the distribution of abdominal obesity associated with metabolic disorders. In Japan, the appropriate reference values for abdominal obesity have not been established in individuals with spinal cord injury (SCI), although there are a number of studies in Western countries. This study evaluates the associations between visceral fat area (VFA), waist circumference (WC) and body mass index (BMI), to examine cutoffs and estimate the error for WC and BMI equivalent to 100 cm2 VFA in Japanese men with SCI.Setting:National Rehabilitation Center for Persons with Disabilities, Japan.Methods:Seventy-four men (aged 45.6 (s.d. 14.3) years) participated in the study. VFA was quantified using computed tomography at the level of the umbilicus, and associations were determined using nonlinear regression analysis. The error of the estimates from the regression equation was assessed using a Bland-Altman plot.Results:The mean VFA was 101.2 (s.d. 53.0) cm2 and 32 subjects had a VFA 100 cm2. The cutoffs for a VFA of 100 cm2 were WC, 81.3 cm and BMI, 22.5 kg m-2. The relationship between the estimated and actual values showed that the error increased as VFA increased, which resulted in a negative proportional bias.Conclusion:The suggested cutoff for Japanese men with SCI is a VFA of 100 cm2, which is lower than that in the healthy able-bodied population for both WC and BMI. Further investigation is needed to determine the reference value for estimating SCI-specific VF accumulation.Spinal Cord advance online publication, 30 September 2014; doi:10.1038/sc.2014.162."

Eighty-six (36.6%) patients had a discharge barrier. The most common reasons for a discharge barrier were: waiting for approval for long-term and supported care or services, residential care, home modifications, family deliberations regarding discharge planning and the provision of equipment necessary for discharge. The reasons accounting for the greatest number of additional hospital days were: home modifications, residential care, equipment necessary for discharge, waiting for approval for long-term and supported care or services and accommodation for people unable to return to their previous residence without readily available alternatives. Over the study period 17.5% (3176/18 184) of all bed-days were occupied by patients deemed to be clinically ready for discharge from the SRU but who had a discharge barrier.Conclusions:Barriers to discharge from rehabilitation for patients with spinal cord damage are common, substantial, and represent an important opportunity for health systems improvement.Spinal Cord advance online publication, 30 September 2014; doi:10.1038/sc.2014.166."
1444,"Systematic diagnosis and therapy of lateral elbow pain with emphasis on elbow instability."
1445,"PURPOSE: In recalcitrant epicondylitis innumerable operative techniques have been published, nevertheless a certain percentage of patients remains symptomatic after operative treatment. We developed an individual, systematic diagnostic pathway including arthroscopic assessment of elbow stability to identify the optimal and respectively less invasive therapy. METHODS: We so far included 40 patients with recalcitrant lateral epicondylitis (mean age 46 +/- 11). 5 patients had previous surgery. In all patients, we did an elbow arthroscopy and a systematic arthroscopic stability testing. 25 patients were treated exclusively arthroscopically once instability was excluded. In 13 patients with slight instability, we did an open debridement of the lateral tendon complex and local refixation. Two patients with severe instability were treated with open debridement and additional stabilization of the LUCL with a trizeps graft. With a minimum follow-up of 1 year, we assessed the DASH score and subjective patient satisfaction. RESULTS: Mean follow-up was 24 +/- 12 months, mean duration of symptoms before surgery was 19 +/- 18 months. The mean DASH score at follow-up was 22 +/- 19.36 patients reported symptoms improvement, 34 patients would repeat surgery given the same situation; in 30 cases, patients expectations had been fulfilled. We did not observe any intraoperative complications or infections. One patient developed joint stiffness requiring reoperation. CONCLUSION: Using a systematic diagnostic pathway including assessment of elbow stability and consecutive individualized, respectively, less invasive surgical procedure we acquired high patients satisfaction and good clinical outcome with a low complication rate.

1446,"A polymorphism in HLA-G modifies statin benefit in asthma."
1447,"Several reports have shown that statin treatment benefits patients with asthma; however, inconsistent effects have been observed. The mir-152 family (148a, 148b and 152) has been implicated in asthma. These microRNAs suppress HLA-G expression, and rs1063320, a common SNP in the HLA-G 3'UTR that is associated with asthma risk, modulates miRNA binding. We report that statins upregulate mir-148b and 152, and affect HLA-G expression in an rs1063320-dependent fashion. In addition, we found that individuals who carried the G minor allele of rs1063320 had reduced asthma-related exacerbations (emergency department visits, hospitalizations or oral steroid use) compared with non-carriers (P=0.03) in statin users ascertained in the Personalized Medicine Research Project at the Marshfield Clinic (n=421). These findings support the hypothesis that rs1063320 modifies the effect of statin benefit in asthma, and thus may contribute to variation in statin efficacy for the management of this disease.The Pharmacogenomics Journal advance online publication, 30 September 2014; doi:10.1038/tpj.2014.55."
1448,"Association of OPRM1 A118G variant with risk of morphine-induced respiratory depression following spine fusion in adolescents."
1449,"The mu1 opioid receptor (OPRM1) genetic variant A118G results in decreased mu-receptor binding potential in the brain and increases morphine requirement. We hypothesized that OPRM1 A118G polymorphism will affect morphine-induced respiratory depression (MIRD) risk in children receiving morphine. A prospective genotype-blinded study was conducted in 88 healthy adolescents (11-18 years; 67% female, 85% Caucasian) who underwent spine fusion for scoliosis. They were followed for 48 h postoperatively for MIRD, pain scores, morphine consumption and use of analgesic adjuvants. Patients were genotyped for OPRM1 A118G variant-76% were wild type (AA) and 24% heterozygous/homozygous for variant (AG/GG). Multivariable logistic regression showed that the risk of MIRD in patients with AA genotype was significantly higher (odds ratio 5.6, 95% CI: 1.4-37.2, P=0.030). Presence of G allele was associated with higher pain scores (effect size 0.73, P=0.045). This novel association is an important step toward predicting MIRD susceptibility and personalizing morphine use.The Pharmacogenomics Journal advance online publication, 30 September 2014; doi:10.1038/tpj.2014.59."
1450,"Novel optical coherence tomography classification of torpedo maculopathy."
1451,"BACKGROUND: Torpedo maculopathy is a rare condition with a twofold clinical significance. Firstly, it is a differential of atypical congenital hypertrophy of the retinal pigment epithelium. Secondly, visual field loss has been reported. We demonstrate the spectrum of structural abnormality of torpedo maculopathy as seen on optical coherence tomography, and correlate this with age of presentation, fundus autofluorescence, retinal sensitivity loss and visual field abnormality. DESIGN: A retrospective, observational case series. PARTICIPANTS: Five Australian patients seen between 2008 and 2013. METHODS: Fundus photography, optical coherence tomography, fundus autofluorescence and visual field analysis. One patient underwent fluorescein angiography. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Lesion appearance on each imaging modality, and visual field analysis. RESULTS: We consistently observed a flat, hypopigmented lesion located in the temporal macula, with a distinctive tip pointing toward the fovea. Optical coherence tomography demonstrated variable retinochoroidal features ranging from mild outer retinal disturbance (Type 1) to outer retinal cavitation (Type 2). Lesion appearance on short-wave autofluorescence showed varying degrees of hypo-autofluorescence. Near-infrared autofluorescence was performed in two patients and showed a well-defined region of hypo-autofluorescence. Microperimetry showed normal sensitivity over the lesion in one patient and a dense paracentral scotoma over the temporal portion of the lesion in another. On Humphrey Field Analysis, only one of two patients tested had a paracentral scotoma. CONCLUSION: Two types of torpedo maculopathy lesions are described here with unique optical coherence tomography, demographic, fundus autofluorescence and retinal sensitivity features. These may represent different stages of the same disease that evolve over several decades."
1452,"IKKalpha negatively regulates ASC-dependent inflammasome activation."
1453,"The inflammasomes are multiprotein complexes that activate caspase-1 in response to infections and stress, resulting in the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Here we report that IkappaB kinase alpha (IKKalpha) is a critical negative regulator of apoptosis-associated specklike protein containing a C-terminal caspase-activation-andrecruitment (CARD) domain (ASC)-dependent inflammasomes. IKKalpha controls the inflammasome at the level of the adaptor ASC, which interacts with IKKalpha in the nucleus of resting macrophages in an IKKalpha kinase-dependent manner. Loss of IKKalpha kinase activity results in inflammasome hyperactivation. Mechanistically, the downstream nuclear effector IKK-related kinase (IKKi) facilitates translocation of ASC from the nucleus to the perinuclear area during inflammasome activation. ASC remains under the control of IKKalpha in the perinuclear area following translocation of the ASC/IKKalpha complex. Signal 2 of NLRP3 activation leads to inhibition of IKKalpha kinase activity through the recruitment of PP2A, allowing ASC to participate in NLRP3 inflammasome assembly. Taken together, these findings reveal a IKKi-IKKalpha-ASC axis that serves as a common regulatory mechanism for ASC-dependent inflammasomes."

In this study, the discriminatory potential of randomly amplified polymorphic DNA and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight (MALDI-TOF) analyses were compared with multilocus sequence typing (MLST) by using 17 beta-lactam-resistant K. pneumoniae isolates of different genotypes. MLST alleles were distributed in 8 sequence types (STs). Among ESBL strains of the same ST, the presence of different beta-lactamase genes was common. RAPD band patterns also revealed 8 types that corresponded to MLST-defined genotypes in 15 out of 17 cases. MALDI-TOF analysis could differentiate 5 clusters of strains. The results of this work show that RAPD may be usable as a rapid screening method for the intrahospital surveillance of K. pneumoniae, allowing a discrimination of clonally related strains. MALDI-TOF-based typing was not strongly corresponding to genotyping and warrants further investigation."
1456,"Predictors of Candida spp. as causative agents of catheter-related bloodstream infections."
1457,"We conducted this study to identify risk factors that may predict whether Candida spp. are causative agents of suspected catheter-related bloodstream infections (CRBSIs). All patients with laboratory-confirmed CRBSIs at Kyoto University Hospital between 2009 and 2011 were included. We compared the clinical features of candidal CRBSIs (78 cases) and non-candidal CRBSIs (258 cases). According to a multivariate analysis, a solid tumor (odds ratio [OR], 3.11; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.75-5.53), total parental nutrition (OR, 2.65; 95% CI, 1.39-5.06), and the administration of anti-anaerobic agents (OR, 2.22; 95% CI, 1.03-4.79) were significantly more common among candidal CRBSIs. The (1,3)-beta-d-glucan (BDG) test was positive among 94.6% (35/37) of candidal CRBSI patients and 9.4% (10/106) of non-candidal CRBSI cases. The administration of antifungal agents may be considered for patients with these risk factors, especially when the BDG test is positive."
1458,"Pharmaceutical care model to assess the medication-related risks of travel."
1459,"Background People are at greater risk of health problems when travelling and a significant number of travel-related health problems are associated with the effects of travel on pre-existing chronic diseases. Medications play a key role in the management of these conditions. However, there is a notable lack of research evaluating the potential medication-related risks associated with travel. Objective To apply a systematic pharmaceutical care model developed to evaluate potential pharmaceutical risks (PPRs) and pharmaceutical care issues (PCIs) in travellers. Setting Adult travellers leaving Cairns International Airport, Australia, for an international destination. Method A cross-sectional survey using semi-structured interviews, including a systematic medication history, followed by the application of a pharmaceutical care model to evaluate each participant for PPRs and PCIs. Main outcome measure Evaluation of standard clinical and travel-related PPRs and PCIs. Results Medications for chronic diseases were being taken by 47.7 % of the 218 travellers interviewed. Although 75.2 % of participants presented with no PPRs, a total of 274 PCIs were identified across 61.5 % of the participants, with an average of 2.04 PCIs per participant. The most prevalent PCIs related to the inadequate precautions taken by some travellers visiting malaria-endemic regions. Although 91 participants recognised that they were travelling to malaria-endemic regions, 65.9 % of these participants were not using malarial chemoprophylaxis, and only 16.5 % were using chemoprophylaxis that fully complied with standard recommendations. The second most prevalent PCI was the need for 18.8 % of participants to be educated about their medications. Other PCIs identified have the potential to increase the risk of acute, travel-related conditions, and complicate the care of travellers, if they inadvertently became unwell while overseas. Conclusion PPRs and PCIs were not identified in all participants. However, the impact of many of the identified medication-related issues could be substantial to the traveller. This study represents the novel application of a pharmaceutical care model to identify potential PPRs and PCIs in travellers that may not be identified by other pre-travel risk assessment methods."
1460,"ALK5 and ALK1 play antagonistic roles in TGFbeta-induced podosome formation in aortic endothelial cells."
1461,"TGFbeta and related cytokines play a central role in the vascular system. In vitro, TGFbeta induces aortic endothelial cells to assemble subcellular actin-rich structures specialized for matrix degradation called podosomes. To explore further this TGFbeta-specific response and determine in which context podosomes form, ALK5 and ALK1 TGFbeta receptor signaling pathways were investigated in bovine aortic endothelial cells. We report that TGFbeta drives podosome formation through ALK5 and the downstream effectors Smad2 and Smad3. Concurrent TGFbeta-induced ALK1 signaling mitigates ALK5 responses through Smad1. ALK1 signaling induced by BMP9 also antagonizes TGFbeta-induced podosome formation but this occurs through both Smad1 and Smad5. Whereas ALK1 neutralization brings ALK5 signals to full potency for TGFbeta-induced podosome formation, ALK1 depletion leads to cell disturbances not compatible with podosome assembly. Thus, ALK1 possesses passive and active modalities. Altogether, we reveal specific features of ALK1 and ALK5 signaling with potential clinical implications."
1462,"Metabolic stress-induced rearrangement of the 14-3-3zeta interactome promotes autophagy via a ULK1- and AMPK-regulated 14-3-3zeta interaction with phosphorylated Atg9A."
1463,"14-3-3zeta promotes cell survival via dynamic interactions with a vast network of binding partners, many of which are involved in stress regulation. We show here that hypoxia (low glucose and oxygen-referred to herein as hypoxia) triggers a rearrangement of the 14-3-3zeta interactome to favor an interaction with the core autophagy regulator Atg9A. Our data suggest that the localization of mammalian Atg9A to autophagosomes requires a phosphorylation on the C-terminus of Atg9A at S761, which creates a 14-3-3zeta docking site. Under basal conditions, this phosphorylation is maintained at a low level and dependent on both ULK1 and AMPK. However, upon induction of hypoxic stress, activated AMPK bypasses the requirement for ULK1 and mediates S761 phosphorylation directly, resulting in an increase in 14-3-3zeta interaction, recruitment of Atg9A to LC3-positive autophagosomes, and enhanced autophagosome production. These data suggest a novel mechanism whereby the level of autophagy induction can be modulated by AMPK/ULK1-mediated phosphorylation of mammalian Atg9A."
1464,"Local and Systemic Therapies for Malignant Pleural Mesothelioma."
1465,"OPINION STATEMENT: Malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) is a challenging disease to treat with median overall survival times ranging between 9-17 months for all stages of disease. Recent clinical trials have improved our understanding of the biology of MPM. However, survival results are still not ideal. For early-stage MPM, patients should be evaluated for trimodality therapy in an experienced cancer center. If treating off-protocol, MPM patients should receive a surgical staging evaluation. The decision to proceed with surgical resection also should be considered after an extensive and thorough pulmonary and cardiac evaluation. If deemed a good surgical candidate, patients should receive surgical resection (pleurectomy/decortication or extrapleural pneumonectomy), adjuvant radiation therapy (hemithoracic external beam or intensity modulated radiation therapy), and either neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy (cisplatin-pemetrexed for 4 cycles). The optimal precise sequence of the trimodality is unclear and should be decided upon by a multidisciplinary consensus for each individual patient. In general, clinical trial participation should be encouraged. Several trials are currently underway to examine intraoperative therapies, vaccines, immunotherapy additions, and novel radiation therapy techniques. Advances in the field of MPM are reliant on participation in clinical trials and identifying biomarkers that are predictive for response to systemic therapies and prognostic for survival benefit."
1466,"c-MET Inhibitors in the Treatment of Lung Cancer."
1467,"OPINION STATEMENT: Lung cancer is the most common malignant neoplasm and constitutes the most common neoplastic cause of death globally. The results of therapies employing standard chemotherapy are unsatisfactory. Currently, efforts are being made to personalize the therapy; numerous clinical studies are being conducted around the world to assess the efficacy and safety of agents directed at molecular targets. One of these molecular targets is the c-MET proto-oncogene, whose primary ligand is hepatocyte growth factor (HGF). C-MET hyperactivity has been observed in numerous neoplasms, including non-small-cell lung carcinoma. Prolonged or continuous activity of the receptor leads to excessive cell proliferation and is related to the development or progression of neoplastic disease. C-MET inhibitors can be classified into three groups: small-molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors of the c-MET receptor (crizotinib, tivantinib, cabozantinib, foretinib), as well as monoclonal antibodies against c-MET (onartuzumab) and against the HGF ligand (ficlatuzumab, rilotumumab). The efficacy and safety of these agents is assessed both in monotherapy and in combination with other molecularly targeted agents. Furthermore, the toxicity profile of c-MET inhibitors is completely different from that of standard chemotherapy. The best understood c-MET inhibitor used in the treatment of non-small-cell lung carcinoma patients is crizotinib. It is registered for patients with the presence of ALK gene rearrangements after the failure of the first line of treatment based on platinum derivatives. The purpose of this present paper is to present clinical studies that assessed the efficacy and safety of c-MET inhibitors for the treatment of non-small-cell lung carcinoma, as well as current indications for the use of these molecules."
1468,"Increased FOXP3 expression in tumour-associated tissues of horses affected with equine sarcoid disease."
1469,"Recent studies suggest that regulatory T cells (Tregs) are associated with disease severity and progression in papilloma virus induced neoplasia. Bovine papilloma virus (BPV) is recognised as the most important aetiological factor in equine sarcoid (ES) disease. The aim of this study was to compare expression levels of Treg markers and associated cytokines in tissue samples of ES-affected equids with skin samples of healthy control horses. Eleven ES-affected, and 12 healthy horses were included in the study. Expression levels of forkhead box protein 3 (FOXP3), interleukin 10 (IL10), interleukin 4 (IL4) and interferon gamma (IFNG) mRNA in lesional and tumour-distant samples from ES-affected horses, as well as in dermal samples of healthy control horses were measured using quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Expression levels were compared between lesional and tumour-distant as well as between tumour-distant and control samples. Furthermore, BPV-1 E5 DNA in samples of ES-affected horses was quantified using quantitative PCR, and possible associations of viral load, disease severity and gene expression levels were evaluated. Expression levels of FOXP3, IL10 and IFNG mRNA and BPV-1 E5 copy numbers were significantly increased in lesional compared to tumour-distant samples. There was no difference in FOXP3 and cytokine expression in tumour-distant samples from ES- compared with control horses. In tumour-distant samples viral load was positively correlated with IL10 expression and severity score. The increased expression of Treg markers in tumour-associated tissues of ES-affected equids indicates a local, Treg-induced immune suppression."
1470,"Antinociceptive effects of three escalating dexmedetomidine and lignocaine constant rate infusions in conscious horses."
1471,"Dexmedetomidine and lignocaine IV are used clinically to provide analgesia in horses. The aims of this study were to investigate the antinociceptive effects, plasma concentrations and sedative effects of 2, 4 and 6 microg/kg/h dexmedetomidine IV, with a bolus of 0.96 microg/kg preceding each continuous rate infusion (CRI), and 20, 40 and 60 microg/kg/min lignocaine IV, with a bolus of 550 microg/kg preceding each CRI, in 10 Swiss Warmblood horses. Electrically elicited nociceptive withdrawal reflexes were evaluated by deltoid muscle electromyography. Nociceptive threshold and tolerance were determined by electromyography and behaviour following single and repeated stimulation. Plasma concentrations of drugs were determined by liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry. Sedation was scored on a visual analogue scale. Dexmedetomidine increased nociceptive threshold to single and repeated stimulation for all CRIs, except at 2 microg/kg/h, where no increase in single stimulation nociceptive threshold was observed. Dexmedetomidine increased nociceptive tolerance to single and repeated stimulation at all CRIs. There was large individual variability in dexmedetomidine plasma concentrations and levels of sedation; the median plasma concentration providing antinociceptive effects to all recorded parameters was 0.15 ng/mL, with a range from <0.02 ng/mL (below the lower limit of quantification) to 0.25 ng/mL. Lignocaine increased nociceptive threshold and tolerance to single and repeated stimulation at CRIs of 40 and 60 microg/kg/min, corresponding to plasma lignocaine concentrations >600 ng/mL. Only nociceptive tolerance to repeated stimulation increased at 20 microg/kg/min lignocaine. Lignocaine at 40 microg/kg/min and dexmedetomidine at 4 microg/kg/h were the lowest CRIs resulting in consistent antinociception. Lignocaine did not induce significant sedation."
1472,"An update on the diagnosis and treatment of canine leishmaniosis caused by Leishmania infantum (syn. L. chagasi)."
1473,"Canine leishmaniosis caused by Leishmania infantum is still a common disease in endemic areas, such as the Mediterranean countries, and has progressively expanded into non-endemic areas like Central and Northern Europe. The aim of this article is to critically review current knowledge on the diagnosis and treatment of this disease. In dogs with typical clinical signs and clinicopathological abnormalities, diagnosis is relatively easy based on the exclusion of major differentials, the demonstration of the parasite (e.g., with lymph node and/or skin cytology) and the presence of Leishmania-specific immunoglobulin G antibodies (quantitative serology). In less typical cases, these criteria together with the exclusion of possible differentials and the demonstration of compatible histological lesions in affected organs and tissues form the basis for a sound diagnosis. In clinically healthy dogs, molecular techniques are the most sensitive means for detecting L. infantum infection. Treatment of canine leishmaniosis should follow clinical staging and is usually based on meglumine antimonate or miltefosine administration for a few weeks in combination with allopurinol for several months. However, allopurinol monotherapy may be used in very mild cases as well as in dogs with end stage kidney disease. Aminosidine administered once daily at a revised dosage shows some promise but additional controlled studies are needed. Close attention to published guidelines regarding treatment and follow-up is necessary to achieve the best possible therapeutic outcome."
1474,"Sickle cell anemia and alpha-thalassemia: A modulating factor in homozygous HbS/S patients in Oman."
1475,"We report the general phenotype severity and the hematological presentation in a cohort of 125 sickle cell anemia (SCA) patients with identical homozygous HbS/S genotype and categorized by identical betaS haplotype, both with and without alpha thalassemia. No clear general phenotype correlation was found when patients were compared regardless of the haplotype but overall, patients with homozygous alpha thalassemia (alpha-/alpha-) had the highest Hb, HCT, RBC and the lowest MCV, MCH and MCHC levels. When patients with identical haplotype were compared, the mildest hematological and clinical conditions were observed in patients of the Asian/Asian haplotype, also known as Arab-Indian haplotype, and carriers of alpha-thalassemia, suggesting an additional ameliorating effect of alpha thalassemia. In conclusion, our results show that alpha thalassemia improves the hematological conditions but amelioration of the general disease severity is only noticed when compared in cohorts of the same haplotype."
1476,"Spectrum of microorganisms in infected walled-off pancreatic necrosis - Impact on organ failure and mortality."
1477,"OBJECTIVE: Data on the microbial spectrum in infected pancreatic necrosis are scarce. Only few studies have addressed this issue in a larger, consecutive group of patients treated by a standardized algorithm. Since 2005 endoscopic, transmural drainage and necrosectomy (ETDN) has been the treatment of choice for walled-off necrosis in our centre. The present study evaluated the microbial spectrum of infected pancreatic necrosis and the possible relationship between infected necrosis, organ failure, and mortality. Furthermore, we investigated whether the aetiology of pancreatitis, use of external drainage, and antibiotic treatment influenced the microbial findings. METHODS: Retrospective review of medical charts on 78 patients who underwent ETDN in our tertiary referral centre between November 2005 and November 2011. RESULTS: Twenty-four patients (31%) developed one or more organ failures, 23 (29%) needed treatment in the intensive care unit (ICU), and 9 (11%) died during hospital admission. The prevailing microbial findings at the index endoscopy were enterococci (45%), enterobacteriaceae (42%), and fungi (22%). There was a significant association between the development of organ failure (p < 0.001), need of treatment in ICU (p < 0.002), in-hospital mortality (p = 0.039) and infected necrosis at the time of index endoscopy. Enterococci (p < 0.0001) and fungi (p = 0.01) were found more frequently in patients who died during admission as compared to survivors. CONCLUSION: Different microbes in pancreatic necrosis may influence the prognosis. We believe that a detailed knowledge on the microbial spectrum in necrotizing pancreatitis may be utilized in the treatment to improve the outcome."
1478,"Bcl-2 maintains the mitochondrial membrane potential, but fails to affect production of reactive oxygen species and endoplasmic reticulum stress, in sodium palmitate-induced beta-cell death."
1479,"Abstract Background. Sodium palmitate causes apoptosis of beta-cells, and the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 has been shown to counteract this event. However, the exact mechanisms that underlie palmitate-induced pancreatic beta-cell apoptosis and through which pathway Bcl-2 executes the protective effect are still unclear. Methods. A stable Bcl-2-overexpressing RINm5F cell clone (BMG) and its negative control (B45) were exposed to palmitate for up to 8 h, and cell viability, mitochondrial membrane potential (Deltapsim), reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, and NF-kappaB activation were studied in time course experiments. Results. Palmitate exposure for 8 h resulted in increased cell death rates, and this event was partially counteracted by Bcl-2. Bcl-2 overexpression promoted in parallel also a delayed induction of GADD153/CHOP and a weaker phosphorylation of BimEL in palmitate-exposed cells. At earlier time points (2-4 h) palmitate exposure resulted in increased generation of ROS, a decrease in mitochondrial membrane potential (Deltapsim), and a modest increase in the phosphorylation of eIF2alpha and IRE1alpha. BMG cells produced similar amounts of ROS and displayed the same eIF2alpha and IRE1alpha phosphorylation rates as B45 cells. However, the palmitate-induced dissipation of Deltapsim was partially counteracted by Bcl-2. In addition, basal NF-kappaB activity was increased in BMG cells. Conclusions. Our results indicate that Bcl-2 counteracts palmitate-induced beta-cell death by maintaining mitochondrial membrane integrity and augmenting NF-kappaB activity, but not by affecting ROS production and ER stress."
1480,"Determination of the axial and circumferential mechanical properties of the skin tissue using experimental testing and constitutive modeling."
1481,"The skin, being a multi-layered material, is responsible for protecting the human body from the mechanical, bacterial, and viral insults. The skin tissue may display different mechanical properties according to the anatomical locations of a body. However, these mechanical properties in different anatomical regions and at different loading directions (axial and circumferential) of the mice body to date have not been determined. In this study, the axial and circumferential loads were imposed on the mice skin samples. The elastic modulus and maximum stress of the skin tissues were measured before the failure occurred. The nonlinear mechanical behavior of the skin tissues was also computationally investigated through a suitable constitutive equation. Hyperelastic material model was calibrated using the experimental data. Regardless of the anatomic locations of the mice body, the results revealed significantly different mechanical properties in the axial and circumferential directions and, consequently, the mice skin tissue behaves like a pure anisotropic material. The highest elastic modulus was observed in the back skin under the circumferential direction (6.67 MPa), while the lowest one was seen in the abdomen skin under circumferential loading (0.80 MPa). The Ogden material model was narrowly captured the nonlinear mechanical response of the skin at different loading directions. The results help to understand the isotropic/anisotropic mechanical behavior of the skin tissue at different anatomical locations. They also have implications for a diversity of disciplines, i.e., dermatology, cosmetics industry, clinical decision making, and clinical intervention."
1482,"Resection of individually identified high-rate high-frequency oscillations region is associated with favorable outcome in neocortical epilepsy."
1483,"OBJECTIVES: High-frequency oscillations (HFOs) represent a novel electrophysiologic marker of endogenous epileptogenicity. Clinically, this propensity can be utilized to more accurately delineate the resection margin before epilepsy surgery. Currently, prospective application of HFOs is limited because of a lack of an exact quantitative measure to reliably identify HFO-generating areas necessary to include in the resection. Here, we evaluated the potential of a patient-individualized approach of identifying high-rate HFO regions to plan the neocortical resection. METHODS: Fifteen patients with neocortical seizure-onset zones (SOZs) underwent intracranial electroencephalographic monitoring. To identify interictal HFOs, we applied an automated, hypersensitive HFO-detection algorithm followed by post hoc processing steps to reject false detections. The spatial relationship between HFO distribution and the SOZ was evaluated. To address high interpatient variability in HFO properties, we evaluated the high-rate HFO region, an unbiased statistical parameter, in each patient. The relationship between resection of the high-rate HFO region and postoperative outcome was examined. RESULTS: Grouped data demonstrated that the rate of ripple (60-200 Hz) and fast ripple (200-500 Hz) was increased in the SOZ (both p < 0.01). Intrapatient analysis of the HFO distribution localized the SOZ in 11 patients. High-rate HFO regions were determined in all patients by an individually adjusted threshold. Resection of high-rate HFO regions was significantly associated with a seizure-free outcome (p < 0.01). The extent/ratio of SOZ or spiking region resection did not differ between seizure-free and seizure-persistent groups. SIGNIFICANCE: Intrapatient analysis of high-rate HFOs provides more detailed description of HFO-generating areas and can mark the areas of clinically significant epileptogenicity-a crucial component of the neocortical epileptic network that should be removed to achieve a good outcome. Validating and adopting an unbiased quantitative HFO parameter has the potential to propel wider and prospective utilization of HFOs in the surgical treatment of neocortical epilepsy and to improve its outcome."
1484,"Lymphocytic hypophysitis associated with pediatric multiple sclerosis."
1485,"BACKGROUND: Lymphocytic hypophysitis (LH) is a rare inflammatory disorder of the pituitary gland and infundibulum most often observed in the setting of autoimmune disease with a variety of clinical and endocrine presentations. The association between lymphocytic hypophysitis and multiple sclerosis has not been reported. PATIENT AND RESULTS: We describe an adolescent boy with polyfocal neurological signs including optic neuritis as well as hypopituitarism and diabetes insipidus related to lymphocytic hypophysitis. His imaging met 2010 McDonald criteria for multiple sclerosis. This diagnosis was further supported by cerebrospinal fluid analysis and a negative evaluation for an alternate diagnosis. Imaging features of lymphocytic hypophysitis include an absent posterior pituitary bright spot with an enlarged cystic pituitary gland, stalk thickening, and improvement with corticosteroid therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Lymphocytic hypophysitis and multiple sclerosis share a common autoimmune pathogenesis, perhaps explaining the co-occurrence of the diseases. The presentation of endocrinologic disturbances such as diabetes insipidus with typical features of a multiple sclerosis attack should prompt further investigation of possible comorbid inflammatory disease involving the hypothalamic-pituitary axis."
1486,"The correlation of dystonia severity and serum transaminases in a child with a brain injury."
1487,"BACKGROUND: Severe anoxic brain injury can lead to prolonged episodes of status dystonicus. Sustained dystonia can result in skeletal muscle breakdown and elevation of serum transaminases, which can initially be confused with polypharmacy-related hepatotoxicity or an underlying metabolic condition. PATIENT: We present a 19-month-old boy who sustained a severe anoxic brain injury in the setting of a viral upper respiratory tract infection. Within 2 weeks after injury, he developed prolonged periods of severe dystonia. RESULTS: Serum creatine kinase peaked at 4504 U/L, alanine transaminase at 183 U/L, and aspartate transaminase at 198 U/L. CONCLUSIONS: This child demonstrated a clear correlation between severity of dystonia after brain injury and changes in serum alanine transaminase, aspartate transaminase, and creatine kinase. In the literature, aspartate transaminase and alanine transaminase elevations have been reported in seizures, myopathies, and extreme exercise. This is the first report of serum transaminase elevation secondary to dystonia. Early identification of skeletal muscle causes of increased alanine transaminase and aspartate transaminase may prevent unnecessary investigations and can reduce concern about medication-related hepatotoxicity."
1488,"Pediatric Ischemic Stroke due to Dengue Vasculitis."
1489,"BACKGROUND: Dengue infection is an important arboviral infection in southeast Asia, especially in India. Neurological manifestations of dengue are increasingly recognized. METHODS: We report an ischemic stroke due to dengue vasculitis in an 8-year-old child. PATIENT: We present a girl with a short febrile illness followed by episodic severe headache, with gradually progressive hemiparesis and visual impairment. Her brain magnetic resonance imaging revealed multiple infarctions in the anterior and posterior circulation. The magnetic resonance angiogram revealed irregular narrowing of bilateral middle cerebral arteries, right anterior cerebral artery, left posterior cerebral, and bilateral vertebral arteries suggestive of vasculitis. Her dengue serology was strongly positive for immunoglobulin M with 68.9 panbio units. The rest of the evaluation for pediatric stroke was unremarkable. She was treated with intravenous followed by oral corticosteroids and recovered totally with resolution of vasculitis on magnetic resonance angiogram over the next 3 months. CONCLUSION: This child illustrates possible immune-mediated vasculitis caused by dengue infection which is rather a rare presentation in a child who subsequently recovered well. One should consider dengue in childhood strokes in endemic regions."
1490,"A Case of Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome Type VIA With a Novel PLOD1 Gene Mutation."
1491,"BACKGROUND: The kyphoscoliotic type of the Ehlers-Danlos syndrome is an autosomal recessive connective tissue disorder characterized by soft extensible skin, laxity of joints, severe muscle hypotonia at birth, and kyphoscoliosis. PATIENT: We describe a 3-year-old girl with the kyphoscoliotic type of the Ehlers-Danlos syndrome whose parents were cousins. She was born with breech presentation by vaginal delivery at term after a normal pregnancy. At birth she manifested hypotonia and congenital kyphosis. On the second postnatal day, subdural and intraparenchymal hemorrhages were detected by magnetic resonance imaging. During follow-up at 18 months of age, strabismus, umbilical hernia, kyphoscoliosis, joint laxity, bilateral hip dislocation, muscular hypotonia, and motor developmental delay. RESULTS: The cranial magnetic resonance imaging revealed periventricular leukomalacia and abnormal signal related to previous hemorrhage. Metabolic investigations and neuromuscular evaluation were normal, excluding other possible explanations of hypotonia. An analysis of urinary cross-links demonstrated an increase in the lysyl-pyridinoline to hydroxylysyl-pyridinoline ratio, suggesting the diagnosis of kyphoscoliotic type of the Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. Molecular analysis of the PLOD1 gene revealed that she had a novel homozygous p.Pro622Argfs*3 (c. 1863_1864dupCG) mutation in exon 17 that is expected to cause complete loss of the enzyme lysyl hydroxylase 1 and to cause kyphoscoliotic type of the Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. CONCLUSIONS: We describe a child with the kyphoscoliotic type of the Ehlers-Danlos syndrome with a novel mutation of the PLOD1 gene. Our observations suggest that vascular lesions in the neonatal period may be a rare additional clinical feature of kyphoscoliotic type of the Ehlers-Danlos syndrome."
1492,"The microcephaly-capillary malformation syndrome in two brothers with novel clinical features."
1493,"BACKGROUND: Microcephaly-capillary malformation syndrome is a newly described neurocutaneous entity that is characterized by congenital and progressive microcephaly, intractable epilepsy, profound developmental delay, multiple small capillary malformations on the skin, and poor somatic growth. Recently, mutations in the STAMBP gene have been identified as causative in the pathogenesis of this syndrome. PATIENTS: We describe two brothers (ages 7 and 12 years) from consanguineous parents of Saudi ancestry. Along with the established main clinical features of this syndrome, these boys exhibited certain novel and distinctive phenotypic features (congenital hypothyroidism and autistic-like behavior with intermittent repetitive hand-flapping movements). Genetic studies revealed the presence of homozygous pathogenic STAMPB mutation. CONCLUSION: This report presents the longest follow-up of patients with microcephaly-capillary syndrome so far reported and emphasize the syndrome's phenotype variability."
1494,"Phenotypic Variability in a Four Generation Family With a p.Thr666Met CACNA1A Gene Mutation."
1495,"BACKGROUND: Familial hemiplegic migraine type 1, episodic ataxia type 2, and spinocerebellar ataxia type 6 are distinct neurological disorders associated with mutations in the CACNA1A gene. Phenotypic variability and clinical overlap are recognized. PATIENTS: We describe a 2-year-old child with transiently decreased consciousness and clinical and radiological signs of early-onset cerebellar atrophy. The family history was significant, and 11 affected members across four generations indicated an unusually wide clinical spectrum including migraine, hemiplegia, coma, and progressive cerebellar ataxia. RESULTS: The p.Thr666Met mutation of the CACNA1A gene was identified in the index patient and in five of his affected relatives who were analyzed. Our patient is the youngest one of this entity diagnosed to date. CONCLUSIONS: Taking into account such a wide clinical expression of these gene mutations, it could be more accurate to speak about ""channel-related diseases"" to characterize the clinical expression according to the genetic analysis and to the phenotypes associated with each CACNA1A gene mutation."
1496,"Neonatal citrullinemia: novel, reversible neuroimaging findings correlated with ammonia level changes."
1497,"BACKGROUND: Citrullinemia type I is an autosomal recessive disorder of the urea cycle in which a patient lacks the cytosolic enzyme, argininosuccinic acid synthetase. This enzyme deficiency results in elevated levels of ammonia, glutamine, and citrulline. The accumulation of ammonia and glutamine causes neurodegenerative changes that are detectible on magnetic resonance imaging. This is the first case report of citrullinemia with repeat magnetic resonance images and electroencephalographs in the acute phase of hyperammonemia. CASE: This 3800 g white boy was born at 40 weeks 4 days gestation to a 25-year-old mother. He was delivered at home to a certified midwife with no reported complications. He was doing well until day of life 4, when the mother reported he would no longer latch to feed. He was observed to have markedly elevated ammonia levels and ultimately diagnosed with citrullinemia type I. The initial magnetic resonance image was markedly abnormal. After aggressive medical management, his repeat magnetic resonance image revealed marked improvement in the acute setting. CONCLUSION: Early and aggressive management of hyperammonemia can result in improved magnetic resonance imaging findings in the acute setting. It is too early to know if this will translate to an improved clinical outcome. Clinical suspicion must remain high for urea cycle disorders in neonates with magnetic resonance image changes similar to those resulting from hypoxic-ischemic injury."
1498,"Affinity for music in wolf-hirschhorn syndrome: two case reports."
1499,"BACKGROUND: Wolf-Hirschhorn syndrome is a congenital malformation syndrome resulting from deletion of the short arm of chromosome 4. Individuals with Wolf-Hirschhorn syndrome may have a ""Greek warrior helmet"" appearance, growth retardation, developmental delay, muscular hypotonia, epilepsy, and difficulty with language including verbal communication. An affinity for music has not previously been reported in these patients. PATIENTS: We describe two patients with Wolf-Hirschhorn syndrome who both have a strong affinity for music. One patient is a 20-year-old woman who likes to listen to music all day and can hum many tunes. The other patient is a 9-year-old girl who is calmed by music and received music therapy, with subsequent improvement in her communication skills (eye contact, joint attention, and vocalizations to request music). CONCLUSIONS: Individuals with Wolf-Hirschhorn syndrome may have a strong affinity for music and may benefit from music therapy. Additional studies are needed to investigate the interest in music in individuals with Wolf-Hirschhorn syndrome."
1500,"Adjunctive levetiracetam treatment in pediatric lennox-gastaut syndrome."
1501,"BACKGROUND: Our aim was to investigate the efficacy and tolerability of levetiracetam as an add-on treatment in pediatric patients with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. METHODS: The study was an open-label, multicenter, observational clinical trial of levetiracetam as an add-on treatment in Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. Fifty-five patients aged 1.1-18.6 years (mean, 10.0 years) were enrolled. The study included a 4-8-week titration period and an 8-week maintenance period. The maintenance dose of levetiracetam was 20-80 mg/kg/day, according to its effectiveness and tolerability. The primary end point was reduction in seizure frequency, and related variables were also evaluated. RESULTS: Among 55 patents, 51 patients (92.7%) completed the study. Thirty-two patients (58.2%) experienced a more than 50% reduction in seizure frequency, and 15 patients (27.3%) became seizure free. A reduction in seizure frequency of more than 50% was observed in 21 of 36 patients (58.3%) with convulsive seizures, 7 of 12 patients (58.3%) with drop attacks, 2 of 4 patients (50.0%) with myoclonic seizures, and 2 of 3 patients (66.7%) with epileptic spasms. Overall, 34.5% of patients reported adverse events. None of the adverse events were life threatening, and the most common adverse event was hyperactivity (12.7%). CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that levetiracetam is a safe and effective treatment in pediatric patients with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome."
1502,"Reliability and validity of the peabody developmental motor scales-second edition for assessing motor development of low birth weight preterm infants."
1503,"BACKGROUND: Motor developmental impairment is a common symptom in low birth weight neonates. The Peabody Developmental Motor Scales-second edition is an instrument for measuring motor abilities in these infants. This study aimed to validate the Peabody Developmental Motor Scales-second edition in Iran. METHODS: This was a prospective clinical validation study. The reliability and validity of the original measure were performed in accordance with published guidelines. To collect data, a total of 88 infants including 58 LBW infants and 30 normal birth weight control patients were included in the study, and the measure was completed for them. The Bayley Scales of Infant Development, second edition, and the Motor Scale (Psychomotor Development Index) also were completed for the study samples. To test reliability, the internal consistency was assessed by Cronbach alpha coefficient. Test-retest reliability was performed using Intraclass Correlation Coefficient at 1-week interval. Validity was evaluated using known groups comparison and criterion validity (convergent validity). RESULTS: The Cronbach alpha coefficient for the Peabody Developmental Motor Scales-second edition was 0.92. Further analysis also indicated that test-retest reliability was excellent (Intraclass Correlation Coefficient = .98). Validity as performed by known groups comparison indicated satisfactory result. The instrument well discriminated among subgroups of the study samples that differed in birth weight. The Psychomotor Development Index score correlated strongly with the Peabody Developmental Motor Scales-second edition (r for Fine Motor Scale = .91, P < 0.001 and r for the Peabody Developmental Motor Scales-second edition Gross Motor Scale = .93, P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest that the Iranian version of Peabody Developmental Motor Scales-second edition is a reliable and valid measure. It can now be used in clinical settings for assessing motor development in low birth weight infants."
1504,"Long-term cognitive sequelae after pediatric brain tumor related to medical risk factors, age, and sex."
1505,"BACKGROUND: Young age at diagnosis and treatment with cranial radiation therapy are well studied risk factors for cognitive impairment in pediatric brain tumor survivors. Other risk factors are hydrocephalus, surgery complications, and treatment with intrathecal chemotherapy. Female gender vulnerability to cognitive sequelae after cancer treatment has been evident in some studies, but no earlier studies have related this to tumor size. The purpose of our study was to find factors correlated with lowered IQ in a nationally representative sample of pediatric brain tumor patients referred for neuropsychologic evaluation. METHODS: Sixty-nine pediatric brain tumor patients, diagnosed 1988-2005 and tested 1995-2006, were included in the study. In a series of stepwise multiple regressions, the relationship of IQ to disease, treatment, and individual variables (sex and syndromes) were evaluated. A subanalysis was made of the covariation between sex and tumor size. RESULTS: The patients had generally suppressed IQ and impairments in executive function, memory, and attention. Lowered IQ was associated with young age at diagnosis, being male, tumor size, and treatment with whole-brain radiation therapy. A sex difference was evident for patients with increased intracranial pressure at diagnosis with males having larger tumors. Tumor size was found to be a better predictor of cognitive sequelae than sex. CONCLUSIONS: Whole-brain radiation therapy, large tumors, young age at diagnosis, and male gender are risk factors for late cognitive sequelae after pediatric brain tumors. When examining sex differences, tumor size at diagnosis needs to be taken into account."
1506,"Efficacy and tolerability of lacosamide as an adjunctive therapy in children with refractory partial epilepsy."
1507,"BACKGROUND: A unicentre, prospective study was performed to investigate the efficacy of lacosamide as adjunctive therapy in children with refractory partial epilepsy. METHODS: The study was performed at a tertiary care hospital over a period of 30 months between November 2011 and May 2014. Seventy-nine children with refractory partial epilepsy (age 5-15 years) who had failed two or more antiepileptic drugs and in whom lacosamide was used as an add-on drug were enrolled. Lacosamide tablets were administered orally, at a dose of 25 mg for 1 week followed by 50 mg twice daily for the remaining period. Efficacy and tolerability evaluation was performed at every visit of titration, maintenance period (3 months), and two follow-up visits at monthly interval. Electrocardiogram and liver function tests were performed before enrollment and at the end of 3 months of lacosamide therapy. Patient's caregiver or investigator observed adverse events were recorded in a predesigned pro forma. RESULTS: A total of 79 patients with uncontrolled partial epilepsy screened from 531 epileptic children were enrolled, after they satisfied the inclusion and exclusion criteria. The mean age of children enrolled was 8.8 +/- 3.1 years (range 5-15 years); 53 children (67.0%) were boys. Mean weight of the patients was 24.2 +/- 9.8 kg. The mean age at the onset of seizures was 6.4 +/- 3.5 years. The mean dose of lacosamide administered was 4.1 mg/kg. Three patients (3.8%) dropped out of the study, because of vomiting, aggressive behavior, and poor response, respectively. Of 76 patients (96.2%) entering the maintenance period, 35 patients (44.3%) were seizure free, 32 patients (40.6%) indicated >/=50% reduction in seizure frequency, 3 patients (3.8%) indicated 25-49% seizure reduction, and 9 patients (11.4%) either had no change in seizure frequency or experience increase in seizure frequency. CONCLUSION: Lacosamide is an effective add-on antiepileptic drug for children with refractory partial epilepsy and is well tolerated."
1508,"Cardioembolic Stroke in Children: A Clinical Presentation and Outcome Study."
1509,"BACKGROUND: Cardiac disease is a common cause of ischemic stroke in children. Limited information is available about its incidence and long-term outcome. METHODS: We undertook a retrospective study of children (age 0-17 years) with cardioembolic arterial ischemic stroke, occurring between 1992 and December 2007. Study subjects were observed at the Winnipeg Children's Hospital and identified using multiple databases and disease code searches. RESULTS: We identified 84 children with arterial ischemic stroke, 17 (20%) of which were cardioembolic stroke (15 non-neonates; 10 females; mean age 4.6 years). The crude annual incidence rate for cardioembolic stroke was estimated to be 0.39 and mortality rate of 0.046 per 100,000 person-years. Stroke occurred commonly in children <5 years (65%) and during hospitalization (65%). Initial presenting symptoms were focal deficits 12 (71%), altered consciousness 5 (29%), seizures 5 (29%), and headache 3 (18%). The mean stroke severity measured by Pediatric National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale was 14.5 (range 2-40) at presentation and 3.7 (range 0-9) at discharge, with mean acute recovery from stroke presentation to discharge of 9.94 (0-32). At 2 years, poor outcome was evident in 10 (59%) children: 2 or >2 Pediatric Stroke Outcome Measure score in 6 (35%), death in 2 (12%), and recurrent stroke in 2 (12%). Factors associated with poor outcome included headache (P = 0.048), high Pediatric National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale at presentation (r = 0.57; P = 0.05) and discharge (r = 0.58; P = 0.05), and high Pediatric Stroke Outcome Measure at discharge (r = 0.77; P = 0.0008). CONCLUSION: Our cohort provides hospital-based incidence estimates for children with cardioembolic stroke. Pediatric National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale performed at different time points can be a helpful tool in measuring stroke recovery and needs to be further explored."
1510,"Erythropoietin: Emerging Role of Erythropoietin in Neonatal Neuroprotection."
1511,"BACKGROUND: In the last two decades, there has been considerable evolution in understanding the role of erythropoietin in neuroprotection. Erythropoietin has both paracrine and autocrine functions in the brain. Erythropoietin binding results in neurogenesis, oligodendrogenesis, and angiogenesis. Erythropoietin and its receptor are upregulated by exposure to hypoxia and proinflammatory cytokines after brain injury. While erythropoietin aids in recovery of locally injured neuronal cells, it provides negative feedback to glial cells in the penumbra, thereby limiting extension of injury. This forms the rationale for use of recombinant erythropoietin and erythropoietin mimetics in neonatal and adult injury models of stroke, traumatic brain injury, spinal cord injury, intracerebral hemorrhage, and neonatal hypoxic ischemia. METHOD: Review of published literature (Pubmed, Medline, and Google scholar). RESULTS: Preclinical neuroprotective data are reviewed, and the rationale for proceeding to clinical trials is discussed. Results from phase I/II trials are presented, as are updates on ongoing and upcoming clinical trials of erythropoietin neuroprotection in neonatal populations. CONCLUSIONS: The scientific rationale and preclinical data for erythropoietin neuroprotection are promising. Phase II and III clinical trials are currently in process to determine the safety and efficacy of neuroprotective dosing of erythropoietin for extreme prematurity and hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy in neonates."
1512,"Volvulus without malposition-a single-center experience."
1513,"BACKGROUND: This is a single-center case series about the rare condition of volvulus without malposition and/or malrotation (VWM) in preterm babies. We focus on diagnostic difficulties, and our results should help to distinguish VWM as a distinct entity different from classical volvulus and segmental volvulus. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Medical chart review of infants with VWM from 2003-2012 was used. RESULTS: A total of 15 patients were identified. All of them had volvulus in the absence of intestinal malposition or other associated intestinal pathologies. All patients were born prematurely. Emergency laparotomy was necessary in all 15 patients. Two groups were identified. Group 1 includes four patients with typical signs of meconium obstruction of prematurity (MOP). Small bowel resection was only necessary in one of these four patients, all survived without residual intestinal lesions. Group 2 consists of 11 patients without signs of MOP-small bowel resection and temporary enterostomy were necessary in all these children. Four patients presented with pneumatosis intestinalis on the abdominal plain film, suggesting necrotizing enterocolitis. Although two infants died, the survivors showed complete recovery. CONCLUSIONS: VWM is a distinct disease of prematurity. When associated with MOP, VWM has a favorable outcome of treatment. In contrast, VWM occurring in the absence of signs of meconium obstruction requires small bowel resection. VWM primarily affects the top of the midgut (ileum). Because of absent malposition, presentation of VWM may be uncharacteristic. Pneumatosis intestinalis in advanced VWM may lead to diagnostic difficulties and a delay in treatment."
1514,"Neural elements behind the hepatoprotection of remote perconditioning."
1515,"BACKGROUND: The ability of remote ischemic perconditioning (RIPER) to protect the liver from ischemic-reperfusion (IR) injury has been reported before; however, the mechanism behind the positive effects of RIPER remains unrevealed. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the potential role of neural elements to transfer protective signals evoked by perconditioning. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Male Wistar rats were randomly allocated into six groups (sham, IR, RIPER +/- denervation; n = 7 per group). Half of the animals underwent left femoral and sciatic nerve resection. In IR and RIPER groups, normothermic, partial (70%) liver ischemia lasting for 60 min was induced; parallel animals in the RIPER groups received perconditioning treatment (4x5-5 min IR, left femoral artery clamping). Hepatic microcirculation and systemic blood pressure were monitored during the first postischemic hour. After 24 h of reperfusion, liver samples were taken for histology and redox-state analysis. Automated image analysis software was used for necrosis quantification. Serum alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, and bilirubin levels were measured. RESULTS: Microcirculation and blood pressure showed significant improvement during reperfusion after perconditioning. This phenomenon was completely abolished by nerve resection (P < 0.05; RIPER versus IR, IR + denervation, and RIPER + denervation). Results of necrosis quantification showed similar pattern. Besides noncharacteristic changes in aspartate aminotransferase levels, alanine aminotransferase values were significantly lower (P < 0.05) in the RIPER group compared with the other IR groups. Mild but significant alterations were observed in liver function assessed by total bilirubin levels. Further supporting results were obtained from analysis of redox homeostasis. CONCLUSIONS: Perconditioning was able to reduce liver IR injury in our model via a mechanism most probably involving interorgan neural pathways."
1516,"Cell recruitment by amnion chorion grafts promotes neovascularization."
1517,"BACKGROUND: Nonhealing wounds are a significant health burden. Stem and progenitor cells can accelerate wound repair and regeneration. Human amniotic membrane has demonstrated efficacy in promoting wound healing, though the underlying mechanisms remain unknown. A dehydrated human amnion chorion membrane (dHACM) was tested for its ability to recruit hematopoietic progenitor cells to a surgically implanted graft in a murine model of cutaneous ischemia. METHODS: dHACM was subcutaneously implanted under elevated skin (ischemic stimulus) in either wild-type mice or mice surgically parabiosed to green fluorescent protein (GFP) + reporter mice. A control acellular dermal matrix, elevated skin without an implant, and normal unwounded skin were used as controls. Wound tissue was harvested and processed for histology and flow cytometric analysis. RESULTS: Implanted dHACMs recruited significantly more progenitor cells compared with controls (*P < 0.05) and displayed in vivo SDF-1 expression with incorporation of CD34 + progenitor cells within the matrix. Parabiosis modeling confirmed the circulatory origin of recruited cells, which coexpressed progenitor cell markers and were localized to foci of neovascularization within implanted matrices. CONCLUSIONS: In summary, dHACM effectively recruits circulating progenitor cells, likely because of stromal derived factor 1 (SDF-1) expression. The recruited cells express markers of ""stemness"" and localize to sites of neovascularization, providing a partial mechanism for the clinical efficacy of human amniotic membrane in the treatment of chronic wounds."
1518,"Alpha-lipoic acid exerts a liver-protective effect in acute liver injury rats."
1519,"BACKGROUND: Recent evidence indicates that alpha-lipoic acid (alpha-LA) has a variety of liver-protective effects through the suppression of inflammatory mediators including tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS). However, there are few reports that alpha-LA markedly enhanced the survival rate in animal models of liver injury with more than 90% death. The aim of this study was to investigate the beneficial effects of alpha-LA in a rat model of acute liver injury and to clarify the mechanisms of alpha-LA action. METHODS: Rats were treated with d-galactosamine and lipopolysaccharide (GalN and LPS) to induce acute liver injury. alpha-LA (100 mg/kg) was administered intraperitoneally 1 h before GalN and LPS injection. Inflammatory mediators including TNF-alpha and iNOS were analyzed. RESULTS: A single injection of alpha-LA improved the survival rate by more than 80%. alpha-LA prevented serum transaminase increases, histopathologic changes, and apoptosis in the liver. In the serum, alpha-LA decreased TNF-alpha production and increased interleukin (IL)-10 production. In the liver, alpha-LA reduced TNF-alpha and IL-6 messenger RNA (mRNA) but enhanced IL-10 mRNA. alpha-LA decreased the expression of iNOS mRNA and its antisense transcript, leading to the reduction of iNOS protein expression and resulting in the inhibition of nitric oxide production. An electrophoretic mobility shift assay revealed that alpha-LA reduced the activation of nuclear factor-kappa B induced by GalN and LPS. CONCLUSIONS: alpha-LA inhibited the induction of inflammatory mediators, such as TNF-alpha and iNOS, in part through the inhibition of nuclear factor-kappa B activation and enhanced the induction of IL-10. alpha-LA may have therapeutic potential for use in the prevention of acute liver injury."
1520,"Automatic seed localization of iodine brachytherapy implants from CT images."
1521,"Radioactive seed implantation has emerged as an effective treatment modality where small radioactive seeds are implanted into the target organ to eradicate the cancer by emitting radiation. Precise seeds localization can indicate whether those seeds deliver sufficient doses of radiation. However, it is challenging and laborious to identify all seeds manually in a short time. Therefore, our purpose in this study was to develop an automatic technique for identifying implanted seeds on any parts of body. The algorithm relies on a 3D adaptive median filter to remove bone structure; white top-hat transform to extract seeds-like objects and further seed classification analysis based on size, shape and their connection etc. Preliminary results on ten patients and seven simulated data show that this approach to be effective and accurate. It resulted in a 96.9 % detection rate with a corresponding 4.7 % false-positive rate for clinical data; a 98.5 % detection rate with a corresponding 4.1 % false-positive rate for the simulated data; and sub-millimeter accuracy for both data sets. This method can achieve robust and accurate seed segmentation through the proposed workflow."
1522,"Simultaneous Inferior Alveolar Nerve Regeneration and Osseointegration With a Nerve Growth Factor-Supplying Implant: A Preliminary Study."
1523,"PURPOSE: Although nerve growth factor (NGF) has been proved to enhance inferior alveolar nerve (IAN) regeneration, its clinical application remains a challenging issue. This study investigated the functional regeneration of IAN injury by supplying NGF using an NGF-supplying implant and its effect on the osseointegration. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In canine IAN transection-and-repair models (n = 9), NGF-supplying implants connected to osmotic pumps were installed just above the transection site. In the right IAN, NGF 300 mug in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) 2 mL was loaded in the pump and pure PBS 2 mL was loaded in the left IAN. The gross clinical finding was evaluated by wound healing, inflammation, implant exposure, and loss of fixture. To evaluate IAN regeneration, electrophysiologic (amplitude, latency, conduction velocity, and peak voltage) and histomorphometric (axon count and density, myelin thickness, and ratio of axon diameter to fiber diameter) analyses were performed. Implant stability quotient, bone-to-implant contact ratio, and new bone area were measured to assess the osseointegration of the NGF-supplying implant. RESULTS: The conduction velocity (2.675 m/second) and peak voltage (1.940 muV) of the NGF group at 6 weeks were considerably higher than those of the PBS group (1.892 m/second and 1.300 muV, respectively). The same results were observed for axon count (NGF vs PBS, 4,576.107 +/- 270.413 vs 3,606.972 +/- 242.876), axon density (10,707.458 +/- 638.835 vs 7,899.781 +/- 1,063.625/mm2), and myelin thickness (1.670 +/- 0.555 vs 1.173 +/- 0.388 mum). There were no meaningful differences for the other parameters. CONCLUSIONS: Supplying NGF with specially designed dental implants can be a new therapeutic approach to enable IAN regeneration and osseointegration simultaneously."
1524,"Management of Ankylosed Maxillary Canine With Single-Tooth Osteotomy in Conjunction With Orthognathic Surgery."
1525,"Ankylosis of teeth is the abnormal adherence of alveolar bone to dentin or cementum. Ankylosis of a submerged maxillary canine can be challenging when striving for an optimal occlusal and esthetic treatment outcome with orthognathic surgery. If an ankylosed tooth does not respond to orthodontic forces, surgical procedures may be indicated to facilitate movement of the tooth to the correct position including a single-tooth segmental osteotomy to reposition the alveolar bone including the ankylosed tooth. The objective of this case report is to describe the treatment of a patient with an ankylosed submerged maxillary right canine, with a single-tooth osteotomy performed to reposition the tooth into its correct position concomitant with double-jaw orthognathic surgery and TMJ surgery."
1526,"[A Case of Newly Diagnosed Moyamoya Disease in a Pregnant Patient with a Ruptured Aneurysm of the Distal Anterior Choroidal Artery Embolized Using N-butyl Cyanoacrylate]."
1527,"Here we describe a rare case of a pregnant patient with a ruptured aneurysm of the distal anterior choroidal artery(AChA)that was embolized using n-butyl cyanoacrylate(NBCA). The 32-year-old patient was 24 weeks pregnant. She suddenly suffered from headache and vomiting. On admission, she was somnolent with left hemiparalysis and had a manual muscle test score of 1/5. Computed tomography(CT)images revealed a cerebral hemorrhage from the right temporal lobe to the lateral ventricle with intraventricular hemorrhage. Cerebral angiography showed severe stenosis at the terminal portion of the right internal carotid artery and a surrounding abnormal vascular network. She was diagnosed with unilateral moyamoya disease, and a direct surgical evacuation of the hemorrhage was performed on the same day. The following day, cerebral angiography showed enlargement of a distal AChA aneurysm that, as suspected, had caused the hemorrhage. The aneurysm was treated by the injection of 20% NBCA into the distal AChA and the aneurysm. After surgery, magnetic resonance imaging showed ischemic changes in the ventral posterolateral nucleus of the thalamus without neurological deficits. The patient became lucid, and the left hemiparalysis improved. The rest of the pregnancy was uneventful. At 37 weeks, she delivered a normal baby by elective caesarean section. When treating pregnant patients with moyamoya disease and a ruptured cerebral artery aneurysm, it is extremely important to cooperate with obstetricians to ensure a safe pregnancy and delivery."
1528,"[Endovascular coil embolization for a ruptured distal anterior choroidal artery aneurysm showing definite short-term enlargement: a case report]."
1529,"Distal anterior choroidal artery aneurysms are quite rare, and appropriate treatment timing and methods remain unclear. Direct surgery of these aneurysms is difficult due to their deep location, small size, and angioarchitecture;however, pseudoaneurysms might disappear spontaneously with conservative treatment. A 65-year-old man with a history of hypertension was admitted to our hospital with a 5-day history of sudden headache and nausea. Computed tomography revealed an intraventricular hematoma located mainly in the right lateral ventricle. Cerebral angiography 7 days after onset revealed a right distal anterior choroidal artery aneurysm and proximal right middle cerebral artery occlusion caused by atherosclerotic changes. Endovascular coil embolization was performed under general anesthesia 14 days after onset. Preoperative angiography demonstrated definite enlargement of the aneurysm and stasis of the contrast agent in the aneurysm in the venous phase. Detachable platinum coils were delivered into the aneurysm and parent artery. The patient was discharged neurologically intact after the procedure. Follow-up angiography 3 months after coil embolization showed complete occlusion of the aneurysm. In recent years, endovascular surgery has emerged as a less invasive treatment option. Early treatment should be considered for patients with ruptured distal anterior choroidal artery aneurysm because these aneurysms might grow and re-rupture in the short term."
1530,"[Intrapituitary adenoma metastasis from lung cancer with progressive cranial nerve palsies: a case report and literature review]."
1531,"We report a rare case of metastasis to a preexisting pituitary adenoma. An 80-year-old man with a history of pituitary adenoma and lung cancer presented with recent onset of bilateral visual impairment, oculomotor nerve palsies, and severe headache. A CT scan revealed a pituitary tumor expanding into the suprasellar region and infiltrating the bilateral cavernous sinuses. We performed transsphenoidal surgery and diagnosed the tumor as lung cancer metastasis to the pituitary adenoma. After the surgery, visual impairment and severe headache were resolved, and the patient underwent radiation therapy for the residual tumor. To the best of our knowledge, 20 cases of metastases to pituitary adenomas have been reported in the literature. Clinical features of metastasis to a pituitary adenoma are different from those of metastasis to normal pituitary gland. In the case of a pituitary lesion with acute aggravation, one should be aware of the possibility of metastasis to preexisting pituitary adenomas."
1532,"[Percutaneous Transluminal Angioplasty Using a Stent for an Aberrant Left Subclavian Artery Stenosis with a Right-sided Aortic Arch: A Case Report]."
1533,"An aberrant left subclavian artery is a rare variant that has been reported to coexist with the right-sided aortic arch in many cases. We encountered a case in which percutaneous transluminal angioplasty using a stent was performed for an aberrant left subclavian artery and left carotid artery. The patient was a 63-year-old man in whom left carotid artery stenosis and abnormal flow pattern of the left vertebral artery was accidently found during an ultrasound screening of his carotid artery. The right-sided aortic arch with the aberrant left subclavian artery was revealed by a cerebral angiogram via the right femoral artery. Despite difficulty in inserting a catheter at the origin of the aberrant left artery, the treatment was completed successfully. To our knowledge, endovascular treatment for an aberrant left subclavian artery has not been reported until date."
1534,"[Efficacy of halo-vest fixation in the assessment and prediction of the effectiveness of permanent fixation in a patient with basilar invagination with ambiguous vertebral instability]."
1535,"Basilar invagination is a developmental anomaly of the craniovertebral junction in which the odontoid abnormally prolapses into the foramen magnum. It is also associated with Chiari malformation, syringomyelia, and hydrocephalus. Patients require surgical treatment to prevent progression of neurological symptoms, but assessment of anterior or posterior decompression can be difficult owing to bone instability and ambiguous compression of neural structures. Here, we describe a case of basilar invagination in a young adult. He presented with neurological symptoms, including syringomyelia, 3 months after a traffic trauma that might have led to instability of the bony structures. Since it was unclear whether the instability of the bony structures contributed to the clinical deterioration, the patient was first treated using halo-vest fixation. Significant improvements were observed in both neurological symptoms and magnetic resonance images. These results justified the invasive fixation and the patient was treated further with an occipito-cervical fusion ; good results were achieved in this case. Owing to the invasiveness of the procedure, occipito-cervical fixation should only be adopted following strict indication criteria. Halo-vest fixation was effective in treating the instability of the bony structures and as a trial treatment for permanent fixation."
1536,"[Ischemic complications of anterior choroidal artery aneurysm treatment]."
1537,"Ischemic stroke of the anterior choroidal artery(AChA)is the most common and serious complication after AChA aneurysm treatment. The purpose of this study was to retrospectively evaluate and compare the treatment-related ischemic complications after surgical clipping and endovascular coiling of AChA aneurysms.<br/> Between June 2006 and March 2013, 32 patients with 34 AChA aneurysms were treated in our hospital by surgical clipping or endovascular coiling. There were 12 cases of ruptured aneurysms, seven cases of unruptured aneurysms, and 15 cases of incidentally identified unruptured aneurysms. Of the 34 aneurysms, 19 were managed with surgical clipping and 15 were managed with endovascular coiling. No rebleeding or retreatment occurred in any case during 4-84 months(median, 25 months)of follow-up, and no significant differences in clinical outcome were seen between clipping and coiling cases. Although there were four cases(11.8%;surgical clipping in three;endovascular coiling in one)of postoperative AChA infarction, we believe that we preserved the blood flow of the AChA during the procedure. The occurrence of subarachnoid hemorrhage and premature rupture during surgical clipping were significantly correlated with AChA infarction."
1538,"[Extradural temporopolar approach for surgical management of paraclinoid lesions]."
1539,"<i>Objective</i>:Surgical treatment of paraclinoid tumors adjacent to important anatomical structures, such as the optic nerve, optic chiasm, pituitary stalk, and internal carotid artery, should emphasize maximum resection and preservation of visual function. Thus, early localization and exposure of the optic nerve, and complete mobilization and decompression of the optic nerve and internal carotid artery, are necessary in order to prevent intraoperative neurovascular injuries. However, this technique requires wide exposure of the optic-carotid space through the interpeduncular cistern. We have developed an extradural temporopolar approach for resection of paraclinoid tumors, which can also allow early devascularization of arteries that feed the tumors. We evaluated the surgical outcomes of this approach, paying special attention to clinical and visual outcomes.<br/> <i>Patients and Methods</i>:Thirteen patients(4 men, 9 women;24-78 years, mean age 54 years), underwent tumor removal using an extradural temporopolar approach between March 2000 and April 2013. We retrospectively reviewed medical charts, radiological findings, intensive care unit flow sheets, and surgical records.<br/> <i>Results</i>:Histological diagnoses included craniopharyngioma(4 cases), pituitary adenoma(3 cases), medial sphenoid ridge meningioma(2 cases), tuberculum sellae meningioma(2 cases), trigeminal neurinoma(1 case), and malignant epidermoid(1 case). Tumors were 1.5-6.0cm in length(mean 3.2cm). Tumors were cystic in all 4 craniopharyngiomas and solid in the other 9 cases. Preoperative neurological deficits included visual disturbance in 10 patients, double vision caused by oculomotor nerve palsy in 2 patients, and vertigo in 1 patient. Additional orbitozygomatic craniotomies were performed in 8 patients. Total tumor removal was performed in 7 patients and subtotal removal performed in 6. The pituitary stalk was microscopically preserved in all patients. Postoperative complications included transient diabetes insipidus in 2 patients, chronic subdural hematoma in 1 patient, and abducens palsy in 1 patient. All complications were completely resolved. Surgical outcomes on discharge were recorded as follows:good recovery(11 patients), moderate disability(1 patient), and severe disability(1 patient, who suffered preoperative consciousness disturbance). Visual outcomes were improved in 7 patients, unchanged in 5, and worsened in 1, with recurrence.<br/> <i>Conclusions</i>:The present extradural temporopolar approach, which allows early decompression of the optic nerve, and early devascularization and detachment of the tumor, may lead to greater tumor resection and improved visual outcomes in patients with paraclinoid tumors."
1540,"A systematic review of behavioural techniques used in nutrition and weight loss interventions among adults with mobility-impairing neurological and musculoskeletal conditions."
1541,"Obesity is a common comorbidity in adults with mobility-impairing neurological and musculoskeletal conditions, such as stroke and arthritis. The interaction between mobility impairments and environmental factors often compromises motivation and ability to engage in healthy behaviours. Such difficulties to engage in healthy behaviours can result in energy imbalance, weight gain and a cycle of functional declines; i.e. obesity can exacerbate mobility impairments and symptoms and increase the likelihood of other comorbid conditions, all of which make it more difficult to engage in healthy behaviours. To help disrupt this cycle, there is a need to identify strategies to optimize energy balance. Thus, this review summarizes clinical trials of nutrition and weight loss interventions in adults with mobility-impairing conditions. Although adults with osteoarthritis were represented in large rigorous clinical trials, adults with neurological conditions were typically represented in studies characterized by a small number of participants, a short-term follow-up and high attrition rates. Studies varied greatly in outcome measures, description and implementation of the interventions, and the strategies used to promote behaviour change. Nutrition and weight loss research in adults with mobility-impairing conditions is still in its formative stages, and there is a substantial need to conduct randomized controlled trials."
1542,"Extracts from Calendula officinalis Offer in Vitro Protection Against H O Induced Oxidative Stress Cell Killing of Human Skin Cells."

The effect of different concentrations (0.125, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0 and 5.0% (v/v)) of Calendula extracts on human skin cells HaCaT in vitro was explored. Doses of 1.0% (v/v) (0.88 mg dry weight/mL) or less showed no toxicity. Cells were also exposed to the Calendula extracts for either 4, 24 or 48 h before being exposed to an oxidative insult (hydrogen peroxide H2 O2 ) for 1 h. Using the MTT cytotoxicity assay, it was observed that two independent extracts of C. officinalis gave time-dependent and concentration-dependent H2 O2 protection against induced oxidative stress in vitro using human skin cells. Pre-incubation with the Calendula extracts for 24 and 48 h increased survival relative to the population without extract by 20% and 40% respectively following oxidative challenge. The antioxidant potential of the Calendula extracts was confirmed using a complimentary chemical technique, the DPPH assay. Calendula extracts exhibited free radical scavenging abilities. This study demonstrates that Calendula flower extracts contain bioactive and free radical scavenging compounds that significantly protect against oxidative stress in a human skin cell culture model.

1544,"Routine, empathic and compassionate patient care: definitions, development, obstacles, education and beneficiaries."
1545,"RATIONALE: We believe that this study represents an innovative approach to clarifying the definitions of routine, empathic and compassionate health care, as well as of sympathy. We emphasize the importance of affective empathy and its intensification in the context of patient suffering (compassion), without abandoning the ideal of clinical equanimity. METHODS: We develop a pedagogical model for clinicians and trainees who are weaker in their empathic skills that includes four levels of growth. We clarify representative obstacles to empathic and compassionate care in education and clinical practice. We summarize the four beneficiaries of empathic and compassionate care (clinicians, patients, trainees, institutions). We suggest areas for future research, including the development of a compassion scale and conclude with a statement on how the conceptual and professional confusion we address adversely impacts patients and trainees. The article represents the consensus work of a group of health care professionals and students at Stony Brook University Hospital and School of Medicine who have been engaged in this project for several years through the Center for Medical Humanities, Compassionate Care, and Bioethics, established in August of 2008. CONCLUSIONS: We discern a shift away from concepts of clinical empathy and compassionate care that deny a significant place for an affective component and that idealize 'detachment'."
1546,"Giardiasis in North West England: faecal specimen requesting rates by GP practice."
1547,"SUMMARY Many cases of giardiasis in the UK are undiagnosed and among other things, diagnosis is dependent upon the readiness of GPs to request a specimen. The aim of this study is to assess the rate of specimens requested per GP practice in Central Lancashire, to examine the differences between GP practices and to estimate the pattern of unexplained spatial variation in the practice rate of specimens after adjustment for deprivation. To achieve this, we fitted a set of binomial and Poisson regression models, with random effects for GP practice. Our analysis suggests that there were differences in the rate of specimens by GP practices (P < 0.001) for a single year, but no difference in the proportion of positive tests per specimen submitted or in the rate of positive specimens per practice population. There was a difference in the cumulative rate of positive specimens per practice population over a 9-year period (P < 0.001). Neither the specimen rate per practice for a single year nor the cumulative rate of positive specimens over multiple years demonstrated significant spatial correlation. Hence, spatial variation in the incidence of giardiasis is unlikely to be confounded by variation in GP rate of specimens."
1548,"Melasma treatment using an erbium:YAG laser: a clinical, immunohistochemical, and ultrastructural study."
1549,"BACKGROUND: Melasma is a common pigmentary disorder that remains resistant to available therapies. OBJECTIVES: The aim of the present study was to evaluate the efficacy of erbium:YAG lasers in the treatment of refractory melasma and investigate the histopathological and ultrastructural changes between melasma skin and adjacent control skin before and after surgery. METHODS: Fifteen Egyptian female patients with melasma unresponsive to previous therapy of bleaching creams and chemical peels were included in this study. Full-face skin resurfacing using an erbium:YAG laser was performed. Clinical parameters included physician and patient assessment, and melasma area and severity index score were done. Adverse effects after laser resurfacing were recorded. Biopsies of lesions and adjacent healthy skin were stained using hematoxylin-eosin, immunohistochemically marked for Melan-A, and evaluated by electron microscopy. RESULTS: The amount of melanin, staining intensity, and number of epidermal melanocytes are increased in melasma lesions as compared to normal skin. Electron microscopic analysis revealed an increased number of mature melanosomes in keratinocytes and melanocytes, with more marked cytoplasmic organelles in melasma skin than in biopsy specimens from normal skin, suggesting increased cell activity. After surgery, the number of melanocytes and concentration of melanin decreased in melasma skin, and the mean melasma area and severity index score decreased dramatically. CONCLUSIONS: Erbium:YAG laser resurfacing effectively improves melasma; however, the almost universal appearance of transient postinflammatory hyperpigmentation necessitates prompt and persistent intervention."
1550,"Understanding biology to tackle the disease: Multiple myeloma from bench to bedside, and back."
1551,"Answer questions and earn CME/CNE Multiple myeloma (MM) is a cancer of antibody-producing plasma cells. The pathognomonic laboratory finding is a monoclonal immunoglobulin or free light chain in the serum and/or urine in association with bone marrow infiltration by malignant plasma cells. MM develops from a premalignant condition, monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS), often via an intermediate stage termed smoldering multiple myeloma (SMM), which differs from active myeloma by the absence of disease-related end-organ damage. Unlike MGUS and SMM, active MM requires therapy. Over the past 6 decades, major advancements in the care of MM patients have occurred, in particular, the introduction of novel agents (ie, proteasome inhibitors, immunomodulatory agents) and the implementation of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in suitable candidates. The effectiveness and good tolerability of novel agents allowed for their combined use in induction, consolidation, and maintenance therapy, resulting in deeper and more sustained clinical response and extended progression-free and overall survival. Previously a rapidly lethal cancer with few therapeutic options, MM is the hematologic cancer with the most novel US Food and Drug Administration-approved drugs in the past 15 years. These advances have resulted in more frequent long-term remissions, transforming MM into a chronic illness for many patients. CA Cancer J Clin 2014. (c) 2014 American Cancer Society."
1552,"Ultrasonographic findings after Achilles tenotomy during Ponseti treatment for clubfeet: Is ultrasound a reliable tool to assess tendon healing?"
1553,"INTRODUCTION: Several studies have claimed ultrasound to be useful and accurate in assessing the healing phase of Achilles tendons after tenotomy during Ponseti treatment for clubfoot deformity. The purpose of our study was to assess the healing process of Achilles tendons ultrasonographically after tenotomy as part of Ponseti clubfoot management and to assess the effects of previously not considered ultrasound properties (anisotropy, partial volume effect), and whether these practical considerations affect accurate measurements which have been claimed possible in previous studies. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We monitored the post-tenotomy healing process in 15 patients (22 tendons) using high frequency ultrasound for a minimum of six months (range 6-14 months). The scanning was discontinued once a tendon looked normal or when the appearance remained unchanged between scans. We also studied nine patients (11 tendons) who had undergone Achilles tenotomies up to seven years previously (range 34-83 months). RESULTS: In the immediate postoperative period, ultrasound showed large variations in the distance of the tenotomy from the calcaneum as well as the obliquity and completeness of the surgical division. We encountered pitfalls in the use of ultrasound to define healing stages that were not described previously. Sonography was inaccurate and subjective in assessing both completeness of the surgical division and tendon measurements. Despite ultrasonographically proven incomplete tendon division in 63 % of cases, the clinical effect of an immediate increase of passive foot dorsiflexion from the pretenotomy position with an obvious palpable tendon gap was achieved in all patients. At the end of the study, 65 % of tendons did not achieve a normal appearance. CONCLUSIONS: We do not think that routine ultrasound studies are of any value as an adjunct to clinical assessment intra- and post-operatively. It can give misleading information regarding the need to complete the tenotomy, which may increase risks associated with a further pass of the scalpel blade."
1554,"Task-evoked substantia nigra hyperactivity associated with prefrontal hypofunction, prefrontonigral disconnectivity and nigrostriatal connectivity predicting psychosis severity in medication naive first episode schizophrenia."
1555,"The widely cited prefrontal dysfunction - excess subcortical dopamine model of schizophrenia posits that prefrontal deficits give rise to cognitive impairments and the disinhibition of subcortical dopamine release underlying psychosis. While this has been one of the most influential schizophrenia models, only a handful of studies have provided evidence supporting it directly in patients with schizophrenia. We previously demonstrated task-evoked substantia nigra hyperactivity in the context of prefrontal hypofunction and prefrontonigral functional disconnectivity. In addition, nigrostriatal functional connectivity was identified as a potential marker of psychosis. Because patients in this prior study had chronic schizophrenia and were treated with antipsychotics, in the present study we tested whether these findings were confounded by illness chronicity and medication effects by seeking to reproduce these findings in an independent sample of antipsychotic naive, first episode (FE) patients. We compared event-related fMRI activations from 12 FE patients with 15 demographically matched healthy control subjects during cognitive testing. We found substantia nigra hyperactivity associated with prefrontal hypofunction and prefrontonigral functional disconnectivity, as well as the magnitude of nigrostriatal functional connectivity positively correlating with severity of psychosis. This study adds to the body of evidence supporting the prefrontal-dopamine model of schizophrenia and further validates nigrostriatal functional connectivity as a marker of psychosis."
1556,"Genetic liability for schizophrenia predicts risk of immune disorders."
1557,"BACKGROUND: Schizophrenia patients and their parents have an increased risk of immune disorders compared to population controls and their parents. This may be explained by genetic overlap in the pathogenesis of both types of disorders. The purpose of this study was to investigate the genetic overlap between schizophrenia and three immune disorders and to compare with the overlap between schizophrenia and two disorders not primarily characterized by immune dysregulation: bipolar disorder and type 2 diabetes. METHODS: We performed a polygenic risk score analysis using results from the schizophrenia Psychiatric GWAS consortium (PGC) (8922 cases and 9528 controls) and five Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium (WTCCC) case samples as target cases: bipolar disorder (n=1998), type 1 diabetes (n=2000), Crohn's diseases (n=2005), rheumatoid arthritis (n=1999), and type 2 diabetes (n=1999). The WTCCC British Birth Cohort and National Blood Service samples (n=3004) were used as target controls. Additionally, we tested whether schizophrenia polygenic risk scores significantly differed between patients with immune disorder, bipolar disorder, and type 2 diabetes respectively. RESULTS: Polygenic risk scores for schizophrenia significantly predicted disease status in all three immune disorder samples (Nagelkerke-R2 1.1%-1.3%; p<0.05). The polygenic risk of schizophrenia in patients with immune disorders was significantly lower than in patients with bipolar disorder (Nagelkerke-R2 6.0%; p<0.05), but higher than in type 2 diabetes patients (Nagelkerke-R2 0.5%; p<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that genetic factors are shared between schizophrenia and immune disorders. This contributes to an accumulating body of evidence that immune processes may play a role in the etiology of schizophrenia."
1558,"Controlling strategy of dormant Mycobacterium tuberculosis."
1559,"OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to review the available literatures on control of latent tuberculosis (TB) infection and propose a new control strategy to shorten the course of TB chemotherapy. DATA SOURCES: The data used in this review were mainly obtained from articles listed in PubMed. The search terms were ""therapy (treatment) of tuberculosis,"" ""therapy (treatment) of latent TB infection,"" and ""vaccine of TB."" STUDY SELECTION: Articles regarding treatment and vaccine of TB were selected and reviewed. RESULTS: The most crucial reason causing the prolonged course of TB chemotherapy is the dormant state of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. tuberculosis). Nevertheless, there are, to date, no effective drugs that can directly kill the dormant cells of M. tuberculosis in clinical therapy. In accordance with the growth cycle of dormant M. tuberculosis in the body, the methods for controlling dormant M. tuberculosis include direct killing with drugs, prevention of dormant M. tuberculosis resuscitation with vaccines, and resuscitating dormant M. tuberculosis with preparations or drugs and then thoroughly killing these resuscitated M. tuberculosis by using anti-TB therapy. CONCLUSIONS: The comprehensive analysis of the above three methods suggests that the drugs directly killing dormant cells are in clinical trials, TMC207 is the most beneficial for controlling TB. Because the side effect of vaccines is less and their action period is long, prevention of dormant cells resuscitation with vaccines is promising. The last control method makes it probable that when a huge number of active cells of M. tuberculosis have been killed and eradicated after 1-month short chemotherapy, only a strong short-term subsequent chemotherapy can completely kill and eradicate the remaining M. tuberculosis. This control strategy is expected to significantly shorten the course of TB chemotherapy and bring a new change and breakthrough in TB treatment."
1560,"Value of qualitative research in polycystic ovary syndrome."
1561,"OBJECTIVE: This article aims to introduce the benefits of qualitative research and to discuss how such research can be applied to the study of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). DATA SOURCES: Relevant articles were published in English as of May 2013 from Pubmed. Terms ""polycystic ovary syndrome/PCOS, qualitative research and methodology"" were used for searching. STUDY SELECTION: Articles studying PCOS with qualitative methods were reviewed. Articles associated with the use of qualitative research in clinical research were cited. RESULTS: Six qualitative studies related to PCOS were found in the literature search. These studies addressed different aspects in PCOS women including their womanhood, lived experience, information need, and experience of treatment with acupuncture. Five of these six studies used phenomenology as guiding theory. CONCLUSION: Quantitative research has been the dominant approach in the field so far, qualitative research is relevant to the advancement of PCOS."
1562,"Renal denervation: a new therapeutic approach for resistant hypertension."
1563,"OBJECTIVE: To review the advances in studies on renal denervation. DATA SOURCES: References concerning renal denervation and resistant hypertension cited in this review were collected from PubMed published in English and those of renal denervation devices from official websites of device manufacturers up to January 2014. STUDY SELECTION: Articles with keywords ""renal denervation"" and ""resistant hypertension"" were selected. RESULTS: Renal and systemic sympathetic overactivity plays an important role in pathology of hypertension as well as other diseases characterized by sympathetic overactivity. Renal denervation is a new, catheter based procedure to reduce renal and systemic sympathetic overactivity by disruption of renal sympathetic efferent and afferent nerves through radiofrequency or ultrasound energy delivered to the endoluminal surface of both renal arteries. Although several studies have shown the efficacy and safety of renal denervation in the treatment of resistant hypertension and the potential benefit of the procedure in other diseases, Symplicity HTN 3 study, the most rigorous clinical trial of renal denervation to date, failed to meet its primary endpoint. The procedure also has other limitations such as the lack of long term, efficacy and safety data and the lack of the predictors for the blood pressure lowering response and nonresponse to the procedure. An overview of current renal denervation devices holding Conformite Europeenne mark is also included in this review. CONCLUSIONS: Renal denervation is a promising therapeutic approach in the management of resistant hypertension and other diseases characterized by sympathetic overactivity. In its early stage of clinical application, the efficacy of the procedure is still controversial. Large scale, blind, randomized, controlled clinical trials are still necessary to address the limitations of the procedure."
1564,"A new charging scheme in an emergency department observation unit under Beijing's basic medical insurance."
1565,"BACKGROUND: The new medical insurance policy (JRSYF(2010) No.255) was released by the Beijing Municipal Government and became effective on January 1, 2011. Medical expenses incurred during a stay in an emergency department (ED) observation unit can be reimbursed as a hospital admission. The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of a new charging scheme during stays in ED observation unit under Beijing's Basic Medical Insurance. METHODS: Data for those patients who had stayed in ED observation unit in 2010 (before the implementation of a new charging scheme) and 2012 (after the implementation of this policy) were retrospectively analyzed in terms of length of stay, patients who were observed (PO), and median medical costs. RESULTS: After the implementation of a new charging scheme, compared with the year of 2010, in year of 2012, there were statistically significant longer lengths of stay at the observation unit (6 (4-9) vs. 5 (4-7) days; P < 0.001), more PO (2 257 vs. 1 783; P < 0.001), and more median medical costs (RMB 6 026 vs. 3 650 Yuan; P < 0.01). The proportion of elderly patients (>/=60 years of age) in 2012 was larger than that in 2010 (70.22% vs. 63.71%; P < 0.01). It was performed on those patients who were admitted after the implementation of a new charging scheme. Compared with patients who were not admitted had stayed in ED observation units, the patients who were admitted had stayed in ED observation units that had a higher proportion for >15 days (36.22% vs. 5.61%; P < 0.01); they had higher median medical costs RMB (9 186 vs. 5 668 Yuan; P < 0.001) and they were more elderly (>/=60 years of age) (86.10% vs. 66.39%; P < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: The new charging scheme under Beijing's Basic Medical Insurance allows patients to get access to inpatient admission more easily. It lowers patients' financial burden in ED observation unit. Since more people stay at ED observation unit, it increases ED payments by the insurance system. However, it slows the turnover rate of ED observation unit and causes overcrowding in ED. Hence, the advantages and disadvantages of the new policy are obvious."
1566,"Computer-assisted preoperative planning for proximal humeral fractures by minimally invasive plate osteosynthesis."
1567,"BACKGROUND: Accurate and precise preoperative planning can provide information instrumental for performing less invasive articular fracture surgery. The purpose of this study was to determine that computer-assisted preoperative planning (CAPP) has the potential to improve efficiency and time in the operating room. METHODS: Sixty-four patients with proximal humeral fractures were treated using locking plates by minimally invasive plate osteosynthesis (MIPO) with CAPP. The time needed for virtual segmentation, reduction, and fixation of the fracture fragments were recorded. Intra and interobserver reliabilities were analyzed using the intraclass correlation coefficient. The clinical function was analyzed using Constant Score and radiology. RESULTS: The mean total time required for CAPP of two-part, three-part, and four-part proximal humeral fractures were (13.63+/-1.38) minutes, (23.14+/-2.18) minutes, and (39.61+/-3.01) minutes, respectively. The intra and interobserver reliabilities for all variables were high, ranging from 0.785 to 0.992. The mean operation time was (50.1+/-6.7) minutes. Fiftytwo patients were followed up with an average time of 34.2 months. The mean Constant Score of the injury side was (82.5 +/- 9.9). Three of the fifty-two patients had four complications. CONCLUSION: The application of CAPP was efficient and reliable, and provided excellent clinical and radiographic outcomes for the treatment of proximal humerus fractures by MIPO."
1568,"Effect of neoadjuvant chemotherapy on expressions of estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2, and Ki-67 in breast cancer."
1569,"BACKGROUND: This study was designed in an attempt to determine the influence of neoadjuvant chemotherapy on estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (Her-2), and Ki-67 expressions in patients with breast cancer. METHODS: Pre- and post-neoadjuvant chemotherapy, paired-tumor specimens from 103 patients with breast cancer administrated with anthracycline or anthracycline combined taxane regimen were collected. Immunohistochemical staining for ER, PR, Her-2, and Ki-67 was performed by the DAKO EnVision method. RESULTS: Among the 103 cases, five patients (4.9%) had a complete response (CR), 82 (79.6%) partial response (PR), 15 (14.6%) stable disease (SD), and one (0.9%) progressive disease (PD), yielding an overall response rate (CR + PR) of 84.5%. Nine patients achieved pathological CR. There was a significant decrease in the average index of Ki-67 postneoadjuvant chemotherapy, compared with that before chemotherapy (24.1% vs. 39.7%, P < 0.001). After neoadjuvant chemotherapy, the changes of Ki-67 in different subtypes of breast cancer were different (P < 0.001), and these changes correlated with response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (P < 0.001). No significant changes in immunohistochemical expression were observed for ER, PR and Her-2. CONCLUSIONS: Neoadjuvant chemotherapy apparently reduced Ki-67 index in primary breast carcinomas, but profiles for ER, PR and Her-2 were not significantly different before and after neoadjuvant chemotherapy. The change of Ki-67 correlated with molecular subtypes and response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy, suggesting that Ki-67 index was a surrogate marker to predict the treatment response of neoadjuvant chemotherapy."
1570,"Preoperative serum alkaline phosphatase: a predictive factor for early hypocalcaemia following parathyroidectomy of primary hyperparathyroidism."
1571,"BACKGROUND: Postoperative hypocalcemia is one of the most common complications following parathyroidectomy for primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT). The aim of this study was to analyze the predictive value of biochemical parameters as indicators for episodes of hypocalcemia in patients undergoing parathyroidectomy for PHPT. METHODS: The patients with PHPT who underwent parathyroidectomy between February 2004 and February 2014 were studied retrospectively at a single medical center. The patients were divided into biochemical, clinical, and no postoperative hypocalcemia groups, based on different clinical manifestations. Potential risk factors for postoperative hypocalcemia were identified and investigated by univariate and multivariate Logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: Of the 139 cases, 25 patients (18.0%) were diagnosed with postoperative hypocalcemia according to the traditional criterion. Univariate analysis revealed only alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and the small area under the curve (AUC) of receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve for ALP demonstrates low accuracy in predicting the occurrence of postoperative hypocalcemia. Based on new criteria, 22 patients were added to the postoperative hypocalcemia group and similar biochemical parameters were compared. The serum ALP was a significant independent risk factor for postoperative hypocalcemia (P = 0.000) and its AUC of ROC curve was 0.783. The optimal cutoff point was 269 U/L and the sensitivity and specificity for prediction were 89.2% and 64.3%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The risk of postoperative hypocalcemia after parathyroidectomy should be emphasized for patients with typical symptoms of hypocalcemia despite their serum calcium level is in normal or a little higher range. Serum ALP is a predictive factor for the occurrence of postoperative hypocalcemia."
1572,"Morphology of bacterial flora in root canals associated with apical abscesses."
1573,"BACKGROUND: Apical abscess is an inflammatory process in the peri-radicular tissues caused by biofilms in the necrotic root canal systems. Therefore, a comprehensive analysis of the bacterial colonization is required for a better understanding of the pathogenesis. This study aimed to investigate the patterns of bacterial infection of root canals of teeth with apical abscesses and to determine whether histological and microbiological findings correlated with clinical conditions. METHODS: Eighteen samples from 18 teeth with apical pathological lesions were analyzed. Nine patients with acute apical abscesses experienced severe pain, and nine patients were asymptomatic with a sinus tract. After extraction, each affected root was divided into two halves. One half was processed for histobacteriologic analysis and examined using light microscopy, and the other half was analyzed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) to determine the patterns of microbial colonization of the root canals. RESULTS: The appearance of each sample subjected to SEM was consistent with the histobacteriologic findings despite the presence or absence of clinical symptoms. Intraradicular biofilms comprising cocci, rods, and/or filaments of amorphous materials were observed in the apical third of the main root canals in all samples. The bacterial biofilms covering the main root canal walls also penetrated the dentinal tubules to varying depths. The morphologies of biofilms varied, and a unique pattern of intraradicular infection was not identified. CONCLUSION: Intraradicular infections formed complex and variable multispecies biofilms and their presence did not correlate with clinical symptoms."

CONCLUSION: This novel reassortment avian influenza A (H10N8) virus in China resulted in fatal human infections, and should be added to concerns in clinical practice."
1576,"Effects of sleep deprivation on polysomnography and executive function in patients with depression."
1577,"BACKGROUND: Sleep deprivation (SD) has been used in treatment of depression disorder, and could effectively improve the patients' depressive symptoms.The aim of the study was to explore the effects of SD on electroencephalographic (EEG) and executive function changes in patients with depression. METHODS: Eighteen depression patients (DPs) and 21 healthy controls (HCs) were enrolled in the present study. The whole night polysomnography (PSG) was recorded by Neurofax-1518K (Nihon Kohden, Japan) system before and after 36 hours of SD. The level of subjects' depression state was assessed by Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), and the executive function was assessed by Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST). RESULTS: Significantly decreased sleep latency (SL; before SD: (31.8+/-11.1) minutes, after SD: (8.8+/-5.2) minutes, P < 0.01) and REM sleep latency (RL; before SD: (79.8+/-13.5) minutes, after SD: (62.9+/-10.2) minutes, P < 0.01) were found after SD PSG in depression patients. Decreased Stage 1 (S1; before SD: (11.7+/-2.9)%, after SD: (7.3+/-1.1)%, P < 0.01) and Stage 2 (S2, before SD: (53.8+/-15.5)%, after SD: (42.3+/-14.7)%, P < 0.05) of non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep, and increased Stage 3 (S3, before SD: (11.8+/-5.5)%, after SD: (23.6+/-5.8)%, P < 0.01) and Stage 4 (S4, before SD: (8.8+/-3.3)%, after SD: (27.4+/-4.8)%, P < 0.01) NREM sleep were also found. After SD, the depression level in patients decreased from 6.7+/-2.1 to 2.9+/-0.7 (P < 0.01). In WCST, the patients showed significantly decreased Response errors (Re, before SD: 22.3+/-2.4, after SD: 18.3+/-2.7, P < 0.01) and Response preservative errors (Rpe, before SD: 11.6+/-3.6, after SD: 9.3+/-2.9, P < 0.05). Depression patients' RE (t = 2.17, P < 0.05) and Rpe (t = 2.96, P < 0.01) also decreased significantly compared to healthy controls. CONCLUSION: SD can improve depression symptom and executive function in depression patients."
1578,"Dissociation between source and item memory in Parkinson's disease."
1579,"BACKGROUND: Episodic memory includes information about item memory and source memory. Many researches support the hypothesis that these two memory systems are implemented by different brain structures. The aim of this study was to investigate the characteristics of item memory and source memory processing in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD), and to further verify the hypothesis of dual-process model of source and item memory. METHODS: We established a neuropsychological battery to measure the performance of item memory and source memory. Totally 35 PD individuals and 35 matched healthy controls (HC) were administrated with the battery. Item memory task consists of the learning and recognition of high-frequency national Chinese characters; source memory task consists of the learning and recognition of three modes (character, picture, and image) of objects. RESULTS: Compared with the controls, the idiopathic PD patients have been impaired source memory (PD vs. HC: 0.65+/-0.06 vs. 0.72+/-0.09, P = 0.001), but not impaired in item memory (PD vs. HC: 0.65+/-0.07 vs. 0.67+/-0.08, P = 0.240). CONCLUSIONS: The present experiment provides evidence for dissociation between item and source memory in PD patients, thereby strengthening the claim that the item or source memory rely on different brain structures. PD patients show poor source memory, in which dopamine plays a critical role."
1580,"Reference value of long-time exercise test in the diagnosis of primary periodic paralysis."
1581,"BACKGROUND: The long-time exercise test (ET) is used to diagnose the primary periodic paralyses (PPs). However the reference values of ET are many and various. This study aimed to investigate the reference value of long-time ET in the diagnosis of PPs. METHODS: We recruited 108 healthy subjects, 68 patients with PPs, and 72 patients with other diseases for the study. The procedure of ET was made on the basis of the McManis' method. Electrical responses were recorded from right abductor digiti minimi (ADM) muscle when stimulation of the ulnar nerve at the wrist. After the compound muscle action potential (CMAP) was monitored, subjects were then asked to contract the muscle as strongly as possible for 5 minutes. CMAPs were recorded for 2 seconds immediately after cessation of exercise, then every 5 minutes for 10 minutes, and finally every 10 minutes for 50 minutes. In general, the CMAP amplitudes will fall below the pre-exercise levels in an hour. The largest decrease was calculated and used as results of ET. RESULTS: The CMAP amplitude decreases had no significant differences between groups when the healthy adults were grouped according to age, gender, height, weight and test time. Decreases in PPs patients (57.76%) were significantly more than in healthy subjects (15.21%) and other disease patients (18.10%, P < 0.001). Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis showed that the best threshold is 35.50%. CONCLUSIONS: In the long-time exercise test, threshold of 35.50% for the CMAP amplitude decrease was identified for abnormal. The result is not influenced by age, gender, height, weight, and test time. About 7.4% of healthy subjects were abnormal in ET."
1582,"Differentiation of neuromyelitis optica from multiple sclerosis in a cohort from the mainland of China."
1583,"BACKGROUND: Although there were criteria for diagnosis of neuromyelitis optica (NMO) and multiple sclerosis (MS), it is still difficult to differentiate NMO from MS, due to the overlapping clinical manifestations. Therefore it is necessary to characterize clinical features of NMO and MS patients in the mainland of China, to simplify the process of disease diagnosis, and to identify criteria for the differential diagnosis of NMO and MS. METHODS: A total of 138 Chinese Han patients from the mainland of China including 73 NMO, 60 MS and 5 MS-like patients with positive NMO-IgG were included in the study. Clinical records were reviewed retrospectively and the results of clinical examination, laboratory experiments, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and evoked potentials (EPs) were compared between NMO and MS patients. In addition, the relationship between the NMO-IgG serologic status and clinical characteristics were analyzed. RESULTS: Compared with MS patients (1.3: 1.0), more female prevalence was observed in NMO patients (4.2: 1.0; P = 0.003). There were also statistically significant differences in visual EPs, oligoclonal bands, brainstem lesions in MRI and longitudinally extensive spinal cord lesions (LESCLs) between NMO and MS patients. Brainstem lesions observed in brain MRI were found in 17.9% of MS patients, over 3.7 times higher than in NMO patients (4.8%, P = 0.024). When stratified NMO patients by NMO-IgG, LESCLs were found in 42.1% of NMO-IgG-negative NMO patients, over 3.5 times higher than in NMO-IgG-positive patients (11.9%, P = 0.008). Statistical difference was also observed in CD4+/CD8+ ratios between NMO-IgG-positive and -negative NMO patients. CONCLUSIONS: Comprehensive analysis of MRI, laboratory and EPs data can facilitate differential diagnosis of MS and NMO. In addition, the combination of LESCLs and brain MRI findings failing to satisfy MRI criteria for MS is highly sensitive and specific for NMO."
1584,"Associations among cerebral microbleeds, cerebral large-artery diseases and endothelial function."
1585,"BACKGROUND: Endothelial dysfunction is not only an early stage of atherosclerosis, but also involved in the pathogenesis of cerebral small-vessel diseases. Patients with cerebral microbleeds (CMBs) may have arteriolosclerosis as well as systemic atherosclerosis. However, little is known about the associations among CMBs, atherosclerosis of cerebral large arteries, and endothelial function. Our study aimed to investigate the relationships among them. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study. Ninety patients hospitalized in Peking University First Hospital with acute ischemic stroke were enrolled consecutively between November 1, 2007 and January 31, 2008. All subjects underwent transcranial Doppler and carotid color duplex ultrasonography to record the intima-media thickness (IMT) of common carotid artery, carotid plaque, and cerebral artery stenosis. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) routine sequences and gradient recall-echo T2(*)-weighted imaging were performed to count CMBs with clinical data blindness. Endothelial function was evaluated using flow-mediated dilation (FMD) and nitroglycerin-mediated dilation (NMD) of the brachial artery. FMD and NMD were examined by an experienced vascular sonographer using a high-resolution ultrasound. RESULTS: Thirty cases (33.3%) had CMBs with counts ranging from 1 to 30. Both FMD ((9.9+/-4.8)% vs. (15.2+/-7.4)%, P = 0.001) and NMD ((13.7+/-6.1)% vs. (19.0+/-7.4)%, P = 0.001) were significantly decreased in CMB-positive patients than in CMB-negative patients. No significant relationships were demonstrated between CMBs and intracranial and/or extracranial artery stenosis. The frequencies of CMBs in patients with IMT>/=1.0 mm, carotid plaque, and extracranial artery stenosis were 37.5%, 39.4%, and 47.6% respectively, with no significant difference, but much higher than in patients with IMT <1.0 mm (5%, P < 0.05). In Logistic regression analysis, impaired FMD (OR = 5.783, 95% CI 1.652-6.718, P = 0.007) and high pulse pressure (OR = 6.228, 95% CI 1.594-3.891, P = 0.009) were independently associated with the presence of CMBs, as well as previous ischemic stroke. In contrast, NMD was not correlated with CMBs. CONCLUSIONS: CMBs may coexist with cerebral atherosclerosis in ischemic stroke. Endothelial dysfunction may play a role in the pathogenesis of CMBs, but may not simply reflect functional alterations of large arteries."
1586,"Daily Affect and Female Sexual Function."
1587,"INTRODUCTION: The specific affective experiences related to changes in various aspects of female sexual function have received little attention as most prior studies have focused instead on the role of clinical mood and anxiety disorders and their influence on sexual dysfunction. AIM: We sought to understand the transaction between daily affect and female sexual function in effort to provide a more nuanced understanding of the interplay between affective and sexual experiences. METHODS: The present study used a 2-week daily diary approach to examine same-day and temporal relations between positive and negative affect states and sexual function in young women. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: We examined the unique relations between positive (i.e., joviality, serenity, self-assurance) and negative (i.e., fear, sadness, hostility) affects and female sexual response (i.e., desire, subjective arousal, vaginal lubrication, orgasmic function, and sexual pain) while controlling for higher order sexual distress, depression, and anxiety, as well as age effects and daily menstruation. RESULTS: Analyses revealed different aspects of both positive and negative affects to be independently related to sexual response indices. Specifically, results indicated that joviality was related to same-day sexual desire and predicted increased desire the following day. This latter relation was partially mediated by sexual activity. Further, greater sexual desire predicted next-day calmness, which was partially mediated by sexual activity. Notably, fear was related to same-day subjective arousal, lubrication, orgasmic function, and vaginal pain, whereas poorer orgasmic function predicted greater next-day sadness. CONCLUSIONS: These findings describe the manner in which changes in affect correspond to variations in female sexual function, thus highlighting the inextricability of mental and sexual health. Further, these findings may offer insight into the progression of normative levels of affect and sexual function as they develop into comorbid depression, anxiety, and sexual dysfunction.

1588,"Evolving insights in cell-matrix interactions: Elucidating how non-soluble properties of the extracellular niche direct stem cell fate."
1589,"The role of soluble messengers in directing cellularbehaviours has been recognised for decades. However, many cellularprocesses including adhesion, migration and stem cell differentiation arealso governed by chemical and physical interactions with non-soluble components ofthe extracellular matrix (ECM). Amongst other effects, a cell's perception of nano-scale features such as substrate topography and ligand presentation, andits ability to deform the matrix via the generation of cytoskeletal tension play fundamentalroles in these cellular processes. As a result, many biomaterials-based tissue engineering and regenerativemedicine strategies aim to harness the cell's perception of substrate stiffness and nano-scale features to direct particular behaviours. However, since cell-ECM interactions vary considerablybetween two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) models, understanding their influence over normal and pathological cell responses in3D systems which better mimic thein vivomicroenvironment is essentialto efficiently translate such insights into medical therapies.This reviewsummarises the key findings in these areas and discusses how insights from 2D biomaterials are being utilised to examinecellular behaviours in more complex 3D hydrogel systems, in which not only matrix stiffness, but also degradability plays an important role, and in which defining the nano-scale ligand presentation presents an additional challenge."
1590,"Lymph node staging using dedicated magnetic resonance contrast agents-the accumulation mechanism revisited."
1591,"When diagnosing cancer, assessing the nodal stage is tremendously important in determining the patient's prognosis. Computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance (MR) imaging (MRI) assessments of the regional lymph node (LN) size and shape are currently used for the initial nodal staging in clinical settings, although this approach has a rather low sensitivity, and biopsy often leads to restaging of the LNs. Acknowledging the great medical need to accurately stage LNs, scientists and clinicians have been working since the late 1980s on MR contrast agents that provide more reliable staging results. Different types of molecules (i.e., iron oxide nanoparticles and Gd-based contrast agent) have shown promising LN accumulation and imaging results, but no clinically approved, dedicated LN staging contrast agent is currently available. The literature describes a mechanism of contrast agent accumulation in the LNs that considers some but not all published experimental evidence. However, confidence in the mechanism of LN accumulation is a prerequisite for the directed synthesis of compounds for accurate and sensitive LN staging. To improve our understanding of the LN contrast agent accumulation mechanism, we reviewed the published data on the enrichment of colloidal MR contrast agent candidates in LNs, and we suggest an extended mechanism for contrast agent enrichment in LNs. For further clarification, physiology and results from drug targeting studies are considered where applicable.

1592,"Risk of New-onset Diabetes after Androgen Deprivation Therapy for Prostate Cancer in the Asian Population."
1593,"BACKGROUND: The associations of androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) with its adverse events in the Asian population remained largely unknown. We investigated the risk of new-onset diabetes mellitus (DM) after ADT for prostate cancer in the Asian population. METHODS: All prostate cancer patients who were treated primarily with radical prostatectomy or radiotherapy, with or without further ADT from 2000 to 2009 were reviewed. Clinical parameters including age, clinical T stage, Gleason score, hypertension, dyslipidemia, impaired fasting glucose, ischemic heart disease, history of stroke, new-onset DM, follow-up duration, form and duration of ADT were reviewed. The risk of DM after ADT was analyzed with Kaplan-Meier method and multivariate Cox regression analysis. RESULTS: 388 patients were included, consisting of 169 patients in the non-ADT group and 219 patients in the ADT group. Upon Kaplan-Meier analysis, ADT group had a higher risk of new-onset DM (P = 0.011). Upon multivariate Cox regression analysis, dyslipidemia (HR 2.32, 95% CI 1.07-5.00, P = 0.032), impaired fasting glucose (HR 5.92, 95% CI 1. 2.27-15.45, P < 0.001) and the use of ADT in the form of GnRH agonist (HR 3.34, 95% CI 1.19-9.39, P = 0.022) and bilateral orchiectomy (HR 6.49, 95% CI 1.48-28.55, P = 0.013) were associated with increased risk of new-onset DM. CONCLUSIONS: There was increased risk of new-onset DM after ADT for prostate cancer in the Asian population. Regular screening of DM can be considered after the initiation of ADT, especially in patients with known history of dyslipidemia and impaired fasting glucose."
1594,"Lessons from glucokinase activators: the problem of declining efficacy."
1595,"The concept of activation of glucokinase (encoded by the Gck gene) as a potential therapy for type 2 diabetes has been explored by several pharmaceutical companies. Small-molecule Gck activators (GKAs) were found to be effective at increasing glucose disposal by hepatocytes and lowering blood glucose in animal models of diabetes during acute or chronic exposure and in human type 2 diabetes during short-term exposure. However, several clinical trials of GKAs were discontinued because of declining efficacy during chronic exposure or other issues. In some cases, declining efficacy was associated with an increase in plasma triglycerides. Accordingly, increased hepatic triglyceride production or steatosis was inferred as the likely cause for declining efficacy. However, other mechanisms of tachyphylaxis need to be considered. For example, elevated glucose concentration causes induction of glucose 6-phosphatase (G6pc) and repression of Gck in hepatocytes. This is best explained as an adaptative mechanism to maintain intracellular phosphometabolite homeostasis. Enhancement of G6pc induction and Gck repression by GKAs because of perturbed phosphometabolite homeostasis could explain the decline in GKA efficacy during chronic exposure. Progress in understanding the mechanisms of intracellular phosphometabolite homeostasis is crucial for development of better drug therapies and appropriate dietary intervention for type 2 diabetes."
1596,"Capsule endoscopy followed by single balloon enteroscopy in children with obscure gastrointestinal bleeding: A combined approach."
1597,"BACKGROUND: This prospective single-centre study aims to evaluate a new diagnostic algorithm using capsule endoscopy, colon capsule endoscopy and single-balloon enteroscopy in the work-up of obscure gastrointestinal bleeding in children. METHODS: The usefulness of a new diagnostic algorithm was assessed comparing the clinically relevant findings revealed by each technique, and evaluating the clinical outcomes during the follow-up. RESULTS: A total of 22 paediatric patients were evaluated (14 male; mean age 12.5 years+/-3.9). Capsule endoscopies were positive in 14 (63.6%), suspicious in 5 (22.7%) and negative in 3 (13.6%). A second look with colon capsule identified new lesions in 2/3 (67%) of previous negative cases. Enteroscopies were able to reach the positive and suspicious findings in all but 2, in which an intraoperative enteroscopy was needed. This combined approach showed positive findings in 21/22 of cases with a diagnostic yield of 95%. Eighteen patients (82%) had a complete resolution after therapy. One patient resolved his symptoms spontaneously. Despite diagnosis, in three patients (13.6%) the gastrointestinal bleeding was not resolved after therapy. CONCLUSION: This algorithm achieves optimal levels of diagnostic yield (95%) and therapeutic outcome (82%). This approach deserves to be studied in a larger multicentre cohort of patients and for a longer follow-up period."
1598,"Safety and Toxicological Evaluation of a Novel, Fermented, Peptide-Enriched, Hydrolyzed Swine Placenta Extract Powder."
1599,"Abstract Placenta is an important organ that connects the developing fetus to allow nutrient uptake, antibody provisions, and gas exchange via the blood supply of the mother. We developed a novel, standardized, stable, water-soluble, peptide-enriched hydrolyzed, Horus(R) fermented placenta powder (HFPEP) from healthy, pathogen-free, swine placenta. Earlier studies demonstrated that HFPEP significantly improves physical fatigue, hepatic functions and repair of muscle fibers. We examined the broad safety of HFPEP in various toxicology models in GLP-approved laboratories. The acute oral toxicity study was conducted in female Sprague-Dawley rats and the acute oral LD50 was found to be greater than 5000 mg/kg body weight. Ames' bacterial reverse mutation assay was conducted to determine the ability of HFPEP to induce reverse mutation at selected histidine loci in five tester strains of Salmonella typhimurium viz. TA1535, TA1537, TA98, TA100, and TA102 in the presence and absence of a metabolic activation system (S9) at the doses of 50, 15, 4.5, 1.35 and 0.41 mg/ml. No mutagenic potential was observed. Mutagenic potential was also evaluated using in vivo micronucleus test, and no mutagenic potential of HFPEP was observed. Repeated dose 28-day oral toxicity study was performed in male and female rats with 14-day recovery period at the dose levels of 250, 500 or 1000 mg/kg. No abnormal clinical signs or toxicity were detected. No observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) of HFPEP was found to be greater than 1000 mg/kg body weight. These studies affirm that HFPEP has broad spectrum safety for human consumption."
1600,"Timing of the initiation of bisphosphonates after surgery for fracture healing: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials."
1601,"We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials. Early administration of bisphosphonates (BPs) after surgery did not appear to delay fracture healing time either radiologically or clinically. Furthermore, the anti-resorptive efficacy of BPs given immediately after surgical repair should positively affect the rate of subsequent fractures. INTRODUCTION: Bisphosphonates (BPs) are widely used in the prophylaxis and treatment of osteoporosis. However, early administration of BPs after surgical repair of a fracture may limit the reserve capacity of bone to heal. The aim of this review and meta-analysis was to analyze the benefits and adverse effects of early administration of BPs and give recommendations regarding when BPs should be utilized. METHODS: We identified randomized controlled trials comparing the early administration of BPs to placebo, delayed BP treatment, or no therapy in adult patients after surgery. The search was performed in PubMed, the Cochrane Library, and Embase. RESULTS: Ten studies with 2888 patients were included. Four trials used alendronate, three trials used zoledronic, two trials used risedronate, and one trial used etidronate. Early administration of BPs was considered less than 3 months after surgery. Patients treated with BP therapy had no significant differences in radiological fracture healing times compared with patients in the control group (mean difference [MD] 0.47, 95 % confidence interval [CI] -2.75 to 3.69). There were also no significant differences in the rate of delay or nonunion of fracture healing (odds ratio [OR] 0.98, 95 % CI 0.64 to 1.50). However, the bone mineral density (BMD) of total hips did significantly improve after 12 months of treatment with BPs. And most bone turnover markers of patients in the study group were significantly decreased. CONCLUSIONS: Early administration of BPs after surgery did not appear to delay fracture healing time either radiologically or clinically. Furthermore, according to the changes in BMD and bone turnover markers, the anti-resorptive efficacy of BPs given immediately after surgical repair should positively affect the rate of subsequent fractures."
1602,"Alcohol consumption and hip fracture risk."
1603,"The present meta-analysis shows that a nonlinear association between alcohol consumption and the risk of hip fracture was observed. Light alcohol consumption was inversely significantly associated with hip fracture risk, whereas heavy alcohol consumption was associated with an elevated hip fracture risk. INTRODUCTION: Previous studies examining the association between alcohol consumption and the risk of hip fracture have reported conflicting findings. Therefore, we conducted a meta-analysis of prospective cohort studies to assess the association between alcohol consumption and the risk of hip fracture. METHODS: PubMed and EMBASE were searched for prospective cohort studies on the relationship between alcohol consumption and the risk of hip fractures. Relative risks (RR) with 95 % confidence intervals (CI) were derived using random-effects models throughout the whole analysis. RESULTS: Eighteen prospective cohort studies were included with 3,730,424 participants and 26,168 hip fracture cases. Compared with non-drinkers, the pooled RR of hip fractures for alcohol consumption was 1.03 (95 % CI, 0.91-1.15), with high heterogeneity between studies (P < 0.001, I 2 = 72.6 %). A nonlinear relationship between alcohol consumption and the risk of hip fracture was identified (P nonlinearity = 0.003). Compared with non-drinkers, the pooled RRs of hip fractures were 0.88 (95 % CI, 0.83-0.89) for light alcohol consumption (0.01-12.5 g/day), 1.00 (95 % CI, 0.85-1.14) for moderate alcohol consumption (12.6-49.9 g/day), and 1.71 (95 % CI, 1.41-2.01) for heavy alcohol consumption (>/=50 g/day). CONCLUSIONS: There was no evidence of publication bias. In conclusion, a nonlinear association between alcohol consumption and the risk of hip fracture was observed in this meta-analysis. Further, light alcohol consumption was inversely significantly associated with hip fracture risk, whereas heavy alcohol consumption was associated with an elevated hip fracture risk."
1604,"High dose corticosteroids in severe leptospirosis: a systematic review."
1605,"The role of corticosteroids in the treatment of severe leptospirosis is unclear. The rationale for their use is that, in severe leptospirosis, there is a severe immunological response that is harmful to the host resulting in multi-organ dysfunction, which is potentially offset by the nonspecific immunosuppression of high dose steroids. We conducted a systematic review of studies that have assessed the use of high dose corticosteroids in patients with severe leptospirosis by searching MEDLINE and Scopus SciVerse without any language or time restrictions. We identified five studies, including one open randomized clinical trial, which had assessed the use of high dose steroids in severe leptospirosis. Four studies demonstrated a benefit of corticosteroids in treating severe disease with pulmonary involvement when administered early in the course of the disease, but these studies had several methodological constraints as highlighted in the text. Only the randomized controlled trial study showed that corticosteroids are ineffective and may increase the risk of nosocomial infections. There is no robust evidence to suggest that high dose corticosteroids are effective in severe leptospirosis, and a well-designed randomized clinical trial is needed to resolve this."
1606,"Frequency of trauma exposure and Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder in Italy: analysis from the World Mental Health Survey Initiative."
1607,"Epidemiological studies have examined the relative importance of Traumatic Events (TEs) in accounting for the societal burden of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). However, most studies used the worst trauma experienced, which can lead to an overestimation of the conditional risk of PTSD. Although a number of epidemiological surveys on PTSD have been carried out in the United States, only a few studies in limited sample have been conducted in Italy. This study, carried out in the framework of the World Mental Health Survey Initiative, is a cross-sectional household survey of a representative sample of the Italian adult population. Lifetime prevalence of TEs and 12-month prevalence of PTSD were evaluated using the Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI). Reports of PTSD associated with randomly selected TEs were weighted by the individual-level probabilities of TE selection to generate estimates of population-level PTSD risk associated with each TE. Network events was the most commonly reported class of TEs (29.4%). War events had the highest conditional risk of PTSD (12.2%). The TEs that contributed most to societal PTSD burden were unexpected death of a loved one (24.1%) and having seen atrocities (18.2%). Being female was related to high risk of PTSD after experiencing a TE. Exposure to network events is commonly reported among Italian adults, but two TEs are responsible for the highest burden associated with PTSD: the unexpected death of someone close and sexual assault. These results can help designing public health interventions to reduce the societal PTSD burden."
1608,"Detection of a Second Mesiobuccal Canal in Maxillary Molars by Swept-source Optical Coherence Tomography."
1609,"INTRODUCTION: The purpose of this study was to investigate the ability of swept-source optical coherence tomographic (SS-OCT) imaging to detect a second mesiobuccal canal (MB2) in maxillary molars compared with visual inspection (VI) and dental operating microscopy (DOM). METHODS: Forty extracted human maxillary molars were examined. After the removal of half the crown and access cavity preparation, the existence of MB2 canals was confirmed based on cross-sectional images of each tooth obtained by micro-computed tomographic scanning as the reference standard. Then, the pulp chamber floor was scanned by SS-OCT imaging. Three dentists independently evaluated the SS-OCT images and the pulp chamber floor under VI and DOM for the presence of MB2 canals. The detection rate of MB2 canals for SS-OCT imaging, VI, and DOM was calculated, and statistical analysis was performed. RESULTS: MB2 canals existed in 19 of 40 teeth (47.5%) using micro-CT imaging. Sensitivity of DOM (0.947) was significantly higher than that of SS-OCT imaging (0.632). Specificity of SS-OCT imaging (0.714) was significantly higher than that of DOM (0.333). No statistically significant differences were found for accuracy among the 3 methods. Kappa values of SS-OCT, VI, and DOM were 0.526, 0.417, and 0.326, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: SS-OCT imaging is noninvasive, involves no ionizing radiation, and is accurate for the detection of MB2 canals."
1610,"Effect of Hypericum perforatum L. Extract on Insulin Resistance and Lipid Metabolic Disorder in High-Fat-Diet Induced Obese Mice."
1611,"Natural product Hypericum perforatum L. has been used in folk medicine to improve mental performance. However, the effect of H. perforatum L. on metabolism is still unknown. In order to test whether H. perforatum L. extract (EHP) has an effect on metabolic syndrome, we treated diet induced obese (DIO) C57BL/6J mice with the extract. The chemical characters of EHP were investigated with thin-layer chromatography, ultraviolet, high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), and HPLC-mass spectrometry fingerprint analysis. Oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), insulin tolerance test (ITT), and the glucose infusion rate (GIR) in hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp test were performed to evaluate the glucose metabolism and insulin sensitivity. Skeletal muscle was examined for lipid metabolism. The results suggest that EHP can significantly improve the glucose and lipid metabolism in DIO mice. In vitro, EHP inhibited the catalytic activity of recombinant human protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B) and reduced the protein and mRNA levels of PTP1B in the skeletal muscle. Moreover, expressions of genes related to fatty acid uptake and oxidation were changed by EHP in the skeletal muscle. These results suggest that EHP may improve insulin resistance and lipid metabolism in DIO mice. Copyright (c) 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd."
1612,"Fracture healing: mechanisms and interventions."
1613,"Fractures are the most common large-organ, traumatic injuries to humans. The repair of bone fractures is a postnatal regenerative process that recapitulates many of the ontological events of embryonic skeletal development. Although fracture repair usually restores the damaged skeletal organ to its pre-injury cellular composition, structure and biomechanical function, about 10% of fractures will not heal normally. This article reviews the developmental progression of fracture healing at the tissue, cellular and molecular levels. Innate and adaptive immune processes are discussed as a component of the injury response, as are environmental factors, such as the extent of injury to the bone and surrounding tissue, fixation and the contribution of vascular tissues. We also present strategies for fracture treatment that have been tested in animal models and in clinical trials or case series. The biophysical and biological basis of the molecular actions of various therapeutic approaches, including recombinant human bone morphogenetic proteins and parathyroid hormone therapy, are also discussed."
1614,"Interstitial lung disease in connective tissue disease-mechanisms and management."
1615,"Pulmonary complications are an important extra-articular feature of autoimmune rheumatic diseases and a major cause of mortality. The underlying pathogenesis probably involves multiple cellular compartments, including the epithelium, lung fibroblasts, and the innate and adaptive immune system. Heterogeneity in the extent and progression of lung fibrosis probably reflects differences in underlying pathogenic mechanisms. Growing understanding of the key pathogenic drivers of lung fibrosis might lead to the development of more effective targeted therapies to replicate the treatment advances in other aspects of these diseases. Interstitial lung disease (ILD) in connective tissue disease (CTD) is characterized using the classification of the idiopathic interstitial pneumonias. Systemic sclerosis is most frequently associated with ILD and, in most of these patients, ILD manifests as a histological pattern of nonspecific interstitial pneumonia. Conversely, in rheumatoid arthritis, the pattern of ILD is most often usual interstitial pneumonia. The key goals of clinical assessment of patients with both ILD and CTD are the detection of ILD and prognostic evaluation to determine which patients should be treated. Data from treatment trials in systemic sclerosis support the use of immunosuppressive therapy, with the treatment benefit largely relating to the prevention of progression of lung disease."
1616,"Providing Integrity, Authenticity, and Confidentiality for Header and Pixel Data of DICOM Images."
1617,"Exchange of medical images over public networks is subjected to different types of security threats. This has triggered persisting demands for secured telemedicine implementations that will provide confidentiality, authenticity, and integrity for the transmitted images. The medical image exchange standard (DICOM) offers mechanisms to provide confidentiality for the header data of the image but not for the pixel data. On the other hand, it offers mechanisms to achieve authenticity and integrity for the pixel data but not for the header data. In this paper, we propose a crypto-based algorithm that provides confidentially, authenticity, and integrity for the pixel data, as well as for the header data. This is achieved by applying strong cryptographic primitives utilizing internally generated security data, such as encryption keys, hashing codes, and digital signatures. The security data are generated internally from the header and the pixel data, thus a strong bond is established between the DICOM data and the corresponding security data. The proposed algorithm has been evaluated extensively using DICOM images of different modalities. Simulation experiments show that confidentiality, authenticity, and integrity have been achieved as reflected by the results we obtained for normalized correlation, entropy, PSNR, histogram analysis, and robustness."
